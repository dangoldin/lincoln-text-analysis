    </h2>
    <p>
      OPINION ON THE LOSS OF GENERAL R. H. MILROY'S DIVISION.
    </p>
    <p>
      October 27, 1863.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June last a division was substantially lost at or near Winchester, Va.
      At the time, it was under General Milroy as immediate commander in the
      field, General Schenck as department commander at Baltimore, and General
      Halleck as general-in-chief at Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Milroy, as immediate commander, was put in arrest, and
      subsequently a court of inquiry examined chiefly with reference to
      disobedience of orders, and reported the evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing is a synoptical statement of the evidence, together with the
      judge-advocate-general's conclusions. The disaster, when it came, was a
      surprise to all. It was very well known to Generals Shenck and Milroy for
      some time before, that General Halleck thought the division was in great
      danger of a surprise at Winchester; that it was of no service commensurate
      with the risk it incurred, and that it ought to be withdrawn; but,
      although he more than once advised its withdrawal, he never positively
      ordered it. General Schenck, on the contrary, believed the service of the
      force at Winchester was worth the hazard, and so did not positively order
      its withdrawal until it was so late that the enemy cut the wire and
      prevented the order reaching General Milroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Milroy seems to have concurred with General Schenck in the opinion
      that the force should be kept at Winchester at least until the approach of
      danger, but he disobeyed no order upon the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some question can be made whether some of General Halleck's dispatches to
      General Schenk should not have been construed to be orders to withdraw the
      force, and obeyed accordingly; but no such question can be made against
      General Milroy. In fact, the last order he received was to be prepared to
      withdraw, but not to actually withdraw until further order, which further
      order never reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serious blame is not necessarily due to any serious disaster, and I cannot
      say that in this case any of the officers are deserving of serious blame.
      No court-martial is deemed necessary or proper in the case.

    <h2>
      TO GENERAL SCHOFIELD.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Private and confidential
    </h3>
    <p>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, October 28, 1863.
    </p>
    <p>
      GENERAL JOHN M. SCHOFIELD:
    </p>
    <p>
      There have recently reached the War Department, and thence been laid
      before me, from Missouri, three communications, all similar in import and
      identical in object. One of them, addressed to nobody, and without place
      or date, but having the signature of (apparently) the writer, is a letter
      of eight closely written foolscap pages. The other two are written by a
      different person, at St. Joseph, Mo., and of the dates, respectively,
      October 12 and 13, 1863, and each inclosing a large number of affidavits.
      The general statements of the whole are that the Federal and State
      authorities are arming the disloyal and disarming the loyal, and that the
      latter will all be killed or driven out of the State unless there shall be
      a change. In particular, no loyal man who has been disarmed is named, but
      the affidavits show by name forty-two persons as disloyal who have been
      armed. They are as follows: [The names are omitted.]
    </p>
    <p>
      A majority of these are shown to have been in the rebel service. I believe
      it could be shown that the government here has deliberately armed more
      than ten times as many captured at Gettysburg, to say nothing of similar
      operations in East Tennessee. These papers contain altogether thirty&mdash;one
      manuscript pages, and one newspaper in extenso, and yet I do not find it
      anywhere charged in them that any loyal man has been harmed by reason of
      being disarmed, or that any disloyal one has harmed anybody by reason of
      being armed by the Federal or State Government. Of course, I have not had
      time to carefully examine all; but I have had most of them examined and
      briefed by others, and the result is as stated. The remarkable fact that
      the actual evil is yet only anticipated&mdash;inferred&mdash;induces me to
      suppose I understand the case; but I do not state my impression, because I
      might be mistaken, and because your duty and mine is plain in any event.
      The locality of nearly all this seems to be St. Joseph and Buchanan
      County. I wish you to give special attention to this region, particularly
      on election day. Prevent violence from whatever quarter, and see that the
      soldiers themselves do no wrong.

      HON. JAMES W. GRIMES.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;The above act of Congress was passed, as I suppose, for
      the purpose of shutting out improper applicants for seats in the House of
      Representatives; and I fear there is some danger that it will be used to
      shut out proper ones. Iowa, having an entire Union delegation, will be one
      of the States the attempt will be made, if upon any. The Governor
      doubtless has made out the certificates, and they are already in the hands
      of the members. I suggest that they come on with them; but that, for
      greater caution, you, and perhaps Mr. Harlan with you, consult with the
      Governor, and have an additional set made out according to the form on the
      other half of this sheet; and still another set, if you can, by studying
      the law, think of a form that in your judgment, promises additional
      security, and quietly bring the whole on with you, to be used in case of
      necessity. Let what you do be kept still.

      Below is an act of Congress, passed last session, intended to exclude

      be used to exclude some who are entitled. Please get with the Governor and
      one or two other discreet friends, study the act carefully, and make
      certificates in two or three forms, according to your best judgement, and
      have them sent to me, so as to multiply the chances of the delegation
      getting their seats. Let it be done without publicity. Below is a form
      which may answer for one. If you could procure the same to be done for the
      Oregon member it might be well.

      The Provost-Marshal-General has issued no proclamation at all. He has in

      authority of the Government, that every citizen who has paid his three
      hundred dollars commutation is liable to be immediately drafted again, or
      that towns that have just raised the money to pay their quotas will have
      again to be subject to similar taxation or suffer the operations of the

    <p>
      HON. MONTGOMERY BLAIR.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;Some days ago I understood you to say that your
      brother, General Frank Blair, desires to be guided by my wishes as to
      whether he will occupy his seat in Congress or remain in the field. My
      wish, then, is compounded of what I believe will be best for the country;
      and it is that he will come here, put his military commission in my hands,
      take his seat, go into caucus with our friends, abide the nominations,
      help elect the nominees, and thus aid to organize a House of
      Representatives which will really support the Government in the war. If
      the result shall be the election of himself as Speaker, let him serve in
      that position. If not, let him retake his commission and return to the
      army for the benefit of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will heal a dangerous schism for him. It will relieve him from a
      dangerous position or a misunderstanding, as I think he is in danger of
      being permanently separated from those with whom only he can ever have a
      real sympathy&mdash;the sincere opponents of slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be a mistake if he shall allow the provocations offered him by
      insincere time-servers to drive him from the house of his own building. He
      is young yet. He has abundant talents&mdash;quite enough to occupy all his
      time without devoting any to temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is rising in military skill and usefulness. His recent appointment to
      the command of a corps, by one so competent to judge as General Sherman,
      proves this. In that line he can serve both the country and himself more
      profitably than he could as a member of Congress upon the floor.

    <p>
      The foregoing is what I would say if Frank Blair was my brother instead of
      yours.

    <h2>
      TO GOVERNOR BRADFORD.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 2, 1863.
    </h3>
    <p>
      His EXCELLENCY A. W. BRADFORD, Governor of Maryland.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR:&mdash;Yours of the 31st ult. was received yesterday about noon, and
      since then I have been giving most earnest attention to the subject-matter
      of it. At my call General Schenck has attended, and he assures me it is
      almost certain that violence will be used at some of the voting places on
      election day unless prevented by his provost-guards. He says that at some
      of those places Union voters will not attend at all, or run a ticket,
      unless they have some assurance of protection. This makes the Missouri
      case, of my action in regard to which you express your approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining point of your letter is a protest against any person
      offering to vote being put to any test not found in the laws of Maryland.
      This brings us to a difference between Missouri and Maryland. With the
      same reason in both States, Missouri has, by law, provided a test for the
      voter with reference to the present rebellion, while Maryland has not. For
      example, General Trimble, captured fighting us at Gettysburg, is, without
      recanting his treason, a legal voter by the laws of Maryland. Even General
      Schenck's order admits him to vote, if he recants upon oath. I think that
      is cheap enough. My order in Missouri, which you approve, and General
      Scherick's order here, reach precisely the same end. Bach assures the
      right of voting to all loyal men, and whether a man is loyal, each allows
      that man to fix by his own oath. Your suggestion that nearly all the
      candidates are loyal, I do not think quite meets the case. In this
      struggle for the nation's life, I cannot so confidently rely on those
      whose elections may have depended upon disloyal votes. Such men, when
      elected, may prove true; but such votes are given them in the expectation
      that they will prove false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor do I think that to keep the peace at the polls, and to prevent the
      persistently disloyal from voting, constitutes just cause of offense to
      Maryland. I think she has her own example for it. If I mistake not, it is
      precisely what General Dix did when your Excellency was elected Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I revoke the first of the three propositions in General Schenek's General
      Order No. 53; not that it is wrong in principle, but because the military,
      being of necessity exclusive judges as to who shall be arrested, the
      provision is too liable to abuse. For the revoked part I substitute the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      That, all provost-marshals and other military officers do prevent all
      disturbance and violence at or about the polls, whether offered by such
      persons as above described, or by any other person or persons whomsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two propositions of the order I allow to stand. General Schenek
      is fully determined, and has my strict orders besides, that all loyal men
      may vote, and vote for whom they please.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your obedient servant,
    </p>

      ADDRESS AT GETTYSBURG

      NOVEMBER 19, 1863.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
      continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
      proposition that all men are created equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or
      any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a
      great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
      field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that
      that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
      do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate&mdash;we can not consecrate&mdash;we
      can not hallow&mdash;this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
      struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or
      detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,
      but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living,
      rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
      here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here
      dedicated to the great task remaining before us&mdash;that from these
      honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave
      the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these
      dead shall not have died in vain&mdash;that this nation, under God, shall
      have a new birth of freedom&mdash;and that government of the people, by
      the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

      be a worse case than to desert and with letters persuading others to
      desert? I cannot interpose without a better showing than you make. When
      did he desert? when did he write the letters?

      PROCLAMATION OF AMNESTY AND RECONSTRUCTION. DECEMBER 8, 1863.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas in and by the Constitution of the United States it is provided
      that the President "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for
      offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment;" and,
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal State governments of
      several States have for a long time been subverted, and many persons have
      committed and are now guilty of treason against the United States; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, with reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been
      enacted by Congress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and
      liberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated, and
      also declaring that the President was thereby authorized at any time
      thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have
      participated in the existing rebellion in any State or part thereof pardon
      and amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions
      as he may deem expedient for the public welfare; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the Congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon
      accords with well-established judicial exposition of the pardoning power;
      and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, with reference to said rebellion, the President of the United
      States has issued several proclamations with provisions in regard to the
      liberation of slaves; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said
      rebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States and to
      reinaugurate loyal State governments within and for their respective
      States:
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do
      proclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have, directly or by
      implication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter
      excepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them,
      with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves and in
      property cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened, and
      upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath
      and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath
      shall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor
      and effect following, to wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God,
      that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the
      Constitution of the United States and the Union of the States thereunder;
      and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of
      Congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so
      long and so far as not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress or by
      decision of the Supreme Court; and that I will in like manner abide by and
      faithfully support all proclamations of the President made during the
      existing rebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so far as not
      modified or declared void by decision of the Supreme Court. So help me
      God."
    </p>
    <p>
      The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all
      who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the
      so-called Confederate Government; all who have left judicial stations
      under the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are or shall have
      been military or naval officers of said so-called Confederate Government
      above the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the navy; all
      who left seats in the United States Congress to aid the rebellion; all who
      resigned commissions in the Army or Navy of the United States and
      afterwards aided the rebellion; and all who have engaged in any way in
      treating colored persons, or white persons in charge of such, otherwise
      than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may have been found
      in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other
      capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that whenever, in any
      of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee,
      Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of
      persons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such State
      at the Presidential election of the year A.D. 1860, each having taken oath
      aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter
      by the election law of the State existing immediately before the so-called
      act of secession, and excluding all others, shall reestablish a State
      government which shall be republican and in nowise contravening said oath,
      such shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and the
      State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional
      provision which declares that "the United States shall guarantee to every
      State in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each
      of them against invasion, and, on application of the legislature, or the
      EXECUTIVE (when the legislature can not be convened), against domestic
      violence."
    </p>
    <p>
      And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that any provision
      which may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed
      people of such State which shall recognize and declare their permanent
      freedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent as a
      temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,
      landless, and homeless class, will not be objected to by the National
      EXECUTIVE.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal State
      government in any State the name of the State, the boundary, the
      subdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws as before the
      rebellion be maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary
      by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if any, not
      contravening said co and which may be deemed expedient by those framing
      the new State government.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation,
      so far as it relates to State governments, has no reference to States
      wherein loyal State governments have all the while been maintained. And
      for the same reason it may be proper to further say that whether members
      sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats
      constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective Houses, and not to
      any extent with the EXECUTIVE. And, still further, that this proclamation
      is intended to present the people of the States wherein the national
      authority has been suspended and loyal State governments have been
      subverted a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal State
      governments may be re-established within said States or in any of them;
      and while the mode presented is the best the EXECUTIVE can suggest, with
      his present impressions, it must not be understood that no other possible
      mode would be acceptable.
    </p>

      D. 1863, and of the Independence of the United States of America the

    <h2>
      ANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, DECEMBER 8, 1863.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another year of health, and of sufficiently abundant harvests, has passed.
      For these, and especially for the improved condition cf our national
      affairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to God is due.
    </p>
    <p>
      We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in
      foreign wars, to aid an inexcusable insurrection, have been unavailing.
      Her Britannic Majesty's government, as was justly expected, have exercised
      their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from
      British ports. The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly
      vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the
      contest. Questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of
      the blockade, and other belligerent operations, between the Government and
      several of the maritime powers, but they have been discussed, and, as far
      as was possible, accommodated, in a spirit of frankness, justice, and
      mutual good-will. It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by
      the impartiality of their adjudications, have commanded the respect and
      confidence of maritime powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain for
      the suppression of the African slave-trade, made on the 17th day of
      February last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It is
      believed that, so far as American ports and American citizens are
      concerned, that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a convention for the
      adjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory, arising out of
      the treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, between the United States and Great
      Britain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the
      citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      A novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime
      jurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba, has
      been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed, in an
      amicable spirit, to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power. A
      convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, to concur
      with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the
      liquidation of the Scheldt dues upon the principles which have been
      heretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters
      of Denmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long-pending controversy between this government and that of Chile
      touching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru, by Chilean officers, of a large
      amount in treasure belonging to citizens of the United States has been
      brought to a close by the award of His Majesty the King of the Belgians,
      to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties. The subject
      was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate,
      and although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large
      as they expected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of His
      Majesty's decision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chile when
      intelligence in regard to it reached that country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joint commission under the act of the last session of carrying into
      effect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims has been
      organized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Difficulties concerning interoceanic transit through Nicaragua are in
      course of amicable adjustment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message, I have
      received a representative from the United States of Colombia, and have
      accredited a minister to that Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my
      attention the uncertain state of international questions touching the
      rights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizens abroad.
      In regard to some governments these rights are at least partially defined
      by treaties. In no instance, however, is it expressly stipulated that in
      the event of civil war a foreigner residing in this country within the
      lines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him
      as a belligerent, in whose behalf the government of his country can not
      expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character. I regret
      to say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and in some
      instances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the United States the
      greater part of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries who
      have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully
      naturalized have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the
      fact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden of proof. It has
      been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want
      of guides to the proper sources of information. These might be supplied by
      requiring clerks of courts where declarations of intention may be made or
      naturalizations effected to send periodically lists of the names of the
      persons naturalized or declaring their intention to become citizens to the
      Secretary of the Interior, in whose Department those names might be
      arranged and printed for general information.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens
      of the United States for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the
      laws of their native countries, to which on becoming naturalized here they
      at once repair, and though never returning to the United States they still
      claim the interposition of this government as citizens. Many altercations
      and great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse. It is
      therefore submitted to your serious consideration. It might be advisable
      to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the United States residing
      abroad may claim the interposition of his government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens under
      pretenses of naturalization, which they have disavowed when drafted into
      the military service. I submit the expediency of such an amendment of the
      law as will make the fact of voting an estoppe against any plea of
      exemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of
      alienage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In common with other Western powers, our relations with Japan have been
      brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the
      hereditary aristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal policy
      of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of nations.
      It is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these difficulties
      may be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to the claim of the
      minister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by
      fire of the residence of the legation at Yedo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia,
      which, it is believed, will result in effecting a continuous line of
      telegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an
      international telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of a telegraph
      between this capital and the national forts along the Atlantic seaboard
      and the Gulf of Mexico. Such communications, established with any
      reasonable outlay, would be economical as well as effective aids to the
      diplomatic, military, and naval service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the last
      Congress, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that
      it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue
      whenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad have been faithful in
      defending American rights. In protecting commercial interests our consuls
      have necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities
      growing out of the war. These they have for the most part met and
      discharged with zeal and efficiency. This acknowledgment justly includes
      those consuls who, residing in Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, Japan, China, and
      other Oriental countries, are charged with complex functions and
      extraordinary powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of the several organized Territories is generally
      satisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been
      entirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New
      Mexico, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore
      understood. I lay before you a communication on this subject from the
      Governor of New Mexico. I again submit to your consideration the
      expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration.
      Although this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with
      greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred,
      there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry,
      especially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron and coal as of
      the precious metals. While the demand for labor is much increased here,
      tens of thousands of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, are
      thronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the United
      States if essential, but very cheap, assistance can be afforded them. It
      is easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation is
      beginning a new life. This noble effort demands the aid and ought to
      receive the attention and support of the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Injuries unforeseen by the Government and unintended may in some cases
      have been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries, both
      at sea and on land, by persons in the service of the United States. As
      this government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries
      are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the United
      States, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners. If the existing
      judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a special court may be
      authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of the character
      referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law.
      Conventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission have been
      proposed to some governments, but no definitive answer to the proposition
      has yet been received from any.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the session I shall probably have occasion to request you
      to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have
      been rendered and damages awarded by admiralty courts, and in other cases
      where this government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle and
      where the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal
      arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by the
      law of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes
      of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may not in
      strictness be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing
      treaty between the United States and a foreign country, the expediency of
      so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such consuls
      as are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emoluments of
      their office or from property not situated in the United States, is
      submitted to your serious consideration. I make this suggestion upon the
      ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our consuls in
      all other countries from taxation to the extent thus indicated. The United
      States, I think, ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international
      trade and commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operations of the Treasury during the last year have been successfully
      conducted. The enactment by Congress of a national banking law has proved
      a valuable support of the public credit, and the general legislation in
      relation to loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers.
      Some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws, but no change in
      their principles or general scope is believed to be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since these measures have been in operation all demands on the Treasury,
      including the pay of the Army and Navy, have been promptly met and fully
      satisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is believed, were ever more
      amply provided and more liberally and punctually paid, and it may be added
      that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever more
      cheerfully borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The receipts during the year from all sources, including loans and balance
      in the Treasury at its commencement, were $901,125,674.86, and the
      aggregate disbursements $895,796,630.65, leaving a balance on the 1st of
      July, 1863, of $5,329,044.21. Of the receipts there were derived from
      customs $69,059,642.40, from internal revenue $37,640,787.95, from direct
      tax $1,485,103.61, from lands $167,617.17, from miscellaneous sources
      $3,046,615.35, and from loans $776,682,361.57, making the aggregate
      $901,125,674.86. Of the disbursements there were for the civil service
      $23,253,922.08, for pensions and Indians $4,216,520.79, for interest on
      public debt $24,729,846.51, for the War Department $599,298,600.83, for
      the Navy Department $63,211,105.27, for payment of funded and temporary
      debt $181,086,635.07, making the aggregate $895,796,630.65 and leaving the
      balance of $5,329,044.21. But the payment of funded and temporary debt,
      having been made from moneys borrowed during the year, must be regarded as
      merely nominal payments and the moneys borrowed to make them as merely
      nominal receipts, and their amount, $181,086,635.07, should therefore be
      deducted both from receipts and disbursements. This being done there
      remains as actual receipts $720,039,039.79 and the actual disbursements
      $714,709,995.58, leaving the balance as already stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the
      estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three-quarters of
      the current fiscal year (1864) will be shown in detail by the report of
      the Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite your attention. It is
      sufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual results will
      exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the
      estimates of that officer heretofore submitted while it is confidently
      expected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debt will be
      found very considerably less than has been anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of the Secretary of War is a document of great interest. It
      consists of:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The military operations of the year, detailed in the report of the
      General in Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The organization of colored persons into the war service.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The exchange of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter of General
      Hitchcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the national
      forces, detailed in the report of the Provost Marshal General.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The organization of the invalid corps, and
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The operation of the several departments of the Quartermaster-General,
      Commissary-General, Paymaster-General, Chief of Engineers, Chief of
      Ordnance, and Surgeon-General.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report,
      except such as would be too extended for this place, and hence I content
      myself by asking your careful attention to the report itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year
      and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been discharged with
      fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been constantly
      increasing in efficiency as the Navy has expanded, yet on so long a line
      it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade. From
      returns received at the Navy Department it appears that more than 1,000
      vessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted? and that the
      value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to over
      $13,000,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      The naval force of the United States consists at this time of five hundred
      and eighty-eight vessels completed and in the course of completion, and of
      these seventy-five are ironclad or armored steamers. The events of the war
      give an increased interest and importance to the Navy which will probably
      extend beyond the war itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The armored vessels in our Navy completed and in service, or which are
      under contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed in
      number those of any other power; but while these may be relied upon for
      harbor defense and coast service, others of greater strength and capacity
      will be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our rightful
      position on the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since
      the introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of war demands
      either a corresponding change in some of our existing navy yards or the
      establishment of new ones for the construction and necessary repair of
      modern naval vessels. No inconsiderable embarrassment, delay, and public
      injury have been experienced from the want of such governmental
      establishments. The necessity of such a navy-yard, so furnished, at some
      suitable place upon the Atlantic seaboard has on repeated occasions been
      brought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is again
      presented in the report of the Secretary which accompanies this
      communication. I think it my duty to invite your special attention to this
      subject, and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval
      purposes upon one of the Western rivers. A naval force has been created on
      those interior waters, and under many disadvantages, within little more
      than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country
      at the commencement of the present Administration. Satisfactory and
      important as have been the performances of the heroic men of the Navy at
      this interesting period, they are scarcely more wonderful than the success
      of our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels, which has
      created a new form of naval power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our country has advantages superior to any other nation in our resources
      of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the immediate
      vicinity of both, and all available and in close proximity to navigable
      waters. Without the advantage of public works, the resources of the nation
      have been developed and its power displayed in the construction of a Navy
      of such magnitude, which has at the very period of its creation rendered
      signal service to the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      The increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7,500 men
      in the spring of 1861 to about 34,000 at the present time has been
      accomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to
      promote that increase. It has been found, however, that the operation of
      the draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruits, is beginning to
      affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if not corrected, be
      likely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper
      vocation and inducing them to enter the Army. I therefore respectfully
      suggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval services by a
      definite provision on this subject which would at the same time be
      equitable to the communities more especially interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      I commend to your consideration the suggestions of the Secretary of the
      Navy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen and also the
      education of officers and engineers for the naval service. The Naval
      Academy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for the highly
      responsible duties which in after life they will be required to perform.
      In order that the country should not be deprived of the proper quota of
      educated officers, for which legal provision has been made at the naval
      school, the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make
      nominations from the States in insurrection have been filled by the
      Secretary of the Navy. The school is now more full and complete than at
      any former period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable
      consideration of Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past fiscal year the financial condition of the Post-Office
      Department has been one of increasing prosperity, and I am gratified in
      being able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled the
      entire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,206.84 and the former
      to $11,163,789.59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417.25. In 1860, the
      year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to
      $5,656,705.49, the postal receipts of that year being $2,645,722.19 less
      that those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of
      transportation has been only about twenty-five per cent, but the annual
      expenditure on account of the same has been reduced thirty-five per cent.
      It is manifest, therefore, that the Post-Office Department may become
      self-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the whole
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The international conference of postal delegates from the principal
      countries of Europe and America, which was called at the suggestion of the
      Postmaster-General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last and concluded its
      deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles established by the
      conference as best adapted to facilitate postal intercourse between
      nations and as the basis of future postal conventions inaugurate a general
      system of uniform international charges at reduced rates of postage, and
      can not fail to produce beneficial results.
    </p>
    <p>
      I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is
      herewith laid before you, for useful and varied information in relation to
      the public lands, Indian affairs, patents, pensions, and other matters of
      public concern pertaining to his Department.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter of
      the present fiscal years was 3,841,549 acres, of which 161,911 acres were
      sold for cash, 1,456,514 acres were taken up under the homestead law, and
      the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military bounties,
      for railroad and other purposes. It also appears that the sale of the
      public lands is largely on the increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen that
      the people of the United States had a higher and more enduring interest in
      the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lands than
      in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sale of them. This
      opinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon the
      subject of our national domain. I may cite as evidence of this the liberal
      measures adopted in reference to actual settlers; the grant to the States
      of the overflowed lands within their limits, in order to their being
      reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation; the grants to railway
      companies of alternate sections of land upon the contemplated lines of
      their roads, which when completed will so largely multiply the facilities
      for reaching our distant possessions. This policy has received its most
      signal and beneficent illustration in the recent enactment granting
      homesteads to actual settlers. Since the 1st day of January last the
      before-mentioned quantity of 1,456,514 acres of land have been taken up
      under its provisions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying
      evidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands, notwithstanding
      the great struggle in which the energies of the nation have been engaged,
      and which has required so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their
      accustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the
      Secretary of the Interior suggesting a modification of the act in favor of
      those engaged in the military and naval service of the United States. I
      doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will,
      without essentially changing the general features of the system, secure to
      the greatest practicable extent its benefits to those who have left their
      homes in the defense of the country in this arduous crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invite your attention to the views of the Secretary as to the propriety
      of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from the mineral lands of
      the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain
      Indian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been
      negotiated, which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional
      action of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the
      possessory rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of lands. It
      is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the
      establishment of permanent friendly relations with such of these tribes as
      have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with our outlying
      settlements and emigrants. Sound policy and our imperative duty to these
      wards of the Government demand our anxious and constant attention to their
      material well-being, to their progress in the arts of civilization, and,
      above all, to that moral training which under the blessing of Divine
      Providence will confer upon them the elevated and sanctifying influences,
      the hopes and consolations, of the Christian faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remodeling our
      Indian system. Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity. The
      details set forth in the report of the Secretary evince the urgent need
      for immediate legislative action.
    </p>
    <p>
      I commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the
      Government in this District to your generous and fostering care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some
      extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between
      the Mississippi River and the northeastern seaboard, which proposition,
      however, failed for the time. Since then, upon a call of the greatest
      respectability, a convention has been held at Chicago upon the same
      subject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to
      the President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay before
      you. That this interest is one which ere long will force its own way I do
      not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to
      what can be done now. Augmented interest is given to this subject by the
      actual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad, under auspices so
      favorable to rapid progress and completion. The enlarged navigation
      becomes a palpable need to the great road.
    </p>
    <p>
      I transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the Department
      of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in that vital
      interest of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted nearly
      twenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea,
      with varying results; the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced
      limits; yet the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad,
      was not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections then just
      past indicated uneasiness among ourselves, while, amid much that was cold
      and menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accents
      of pity that we are too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our commerce
      was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from
      foreign shores, and we were threatened with such additions from the same
      quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade. We
      had failed to elicit from European governments anything hopeful upon this
      subject. The preliminary emancipation proclamation, issued in September,
      was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year. A month
      later the final proclamation came, including the announcement that colored
      men of suitable condition would be received into the war service. The
      policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future
      a new aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain
      conflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil
      administration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect
      emancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the
      rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military
      measure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it
      might come, and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be
      presented. It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and
      doubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take
      another review. The rebel borders are pressed still farther back, and by
      the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated by the
      rebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical communication
      between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been substantially cleared of
      insurgent control, and influential citizens in each, owners of slaves and
      advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly
      for emancipation in their respective States. Of those States not included
      in the emancipation proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither of which
      three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery
      into new Territories, dispute now only as to the best mode of removing it
      within their own limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100,000
      are now in the United States military service, about one-half of which
      number actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage
      of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the places
      which otherwise must be filled with so many white men. So far as tested,
      it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any. No servile
      insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of
      emancipation and arming the blacks. These measures have been much
      discussed in foreign countries, and, contemporary with such discussion,
      the tone of public sentiment there is much improved. At home the same
      measures have been fully discussed, supported, criticized, and denounced,
      and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose
      official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial. Thus we
      have the new reckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends
      of the Union is past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption
      of the national authority within the States wherein that authority has
      been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of
      which is herewith transmitted. On examination of this proclamation it will
      appear, as is believed, that nothing will be attempted beyond what is
      amply justified by the Constitution. True, the form of an oath is given,
      but no man is coerced to take it. The man is promised a pardon only in
      case he voluntarily takes the oath. The Constitution authorizes the
      Executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion,
      and this includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully established by
      judicial and other authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also proffered that if in any of the States named a State government
      shall be in the mode prescribed set up, such government shall be
      recognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that under it the
      State shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected against
      invasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the
      United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form
      of government and to protect the State in the cases stated is explicit and
      full. But why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State
      government set up in this particular way? This section of the Constitution
      contemplates a case wherein the element within a State favorable to
      republican government in the Union may be too feeble for an opposite and
      hostile element external to or even within the State, and such are
      precisely the cases with which we are now dealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State government,
      constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element
      against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply
      absurd. There must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements,
      so as to build only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently
      liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation
      of his former unsoundness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political
      body an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and to
      the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to
      slavery? Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the
      purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them their
      fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my
      judgment, they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they
      were intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever
      of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith. I
      may add at this point that while I remain in my present position I shall
      not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall
      I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that
      proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress. For these and other
      reasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be
      included in the oath, and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim
      it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights, which he has
      clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms
      which he shall deem wisest for the public interest. It should be observed
      also that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating
      power of legislation and supreme judicial decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonable
      temporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of
      possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend
      all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States. It is
      hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those States may be
      somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if to this
      extent this vital matter be left to themselves, while no power of the
      National Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political
      framework of the States on what is called reconstruction is made in the
      hope that it may do good without danger of harm. It will save labor and
      avoid great confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why any proclamation now upon this subject? This question is beset
      with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be
      taken too soon. In some States the elements for resumption seem ready for
      action, but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point&mdash;a
      plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than B that of A?
      And if A and B should agree, how can they know but that the General
      Government here will reject their plan? By the proclamation a plan is
      presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which
      they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This may bring them
      to act sooner than they otherwise would.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the National
      Executive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be
      more safely left to further developments. Care has been taken to so shape
      the document as to avoid embarrassments from this source. Saying that on
      certain terms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored, it is
      not said that other classes or other terms will never be included. Saying
      that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way, it
      is not said it will never be accepted in any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movements by State action for emancipation in several of the States
      not included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound
      gratulation. And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so
      earnestly urged upon this subject my general views and feelings remain
      unchanged and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of
      aiding these important steps to a great consummation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of other cares, however important we must not lose sight of
      the fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power
      alone we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the
      contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them.
      Until that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere
      what is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest care must still be
      directed to the Army and Navy who have thus far borne their harder part so
      nobly and well; and it may be esteemed fortunate that giving the greatest
      efficiency to these indispensable arms we do also honorably recognize the
      gallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them, and to whom
      more than to others the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom
      disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated.

    <h3>
      TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
    </h3>
    <p>
      In conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that
      Captain John Rogers United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks from
      Congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the
      engagement with the rebel armed ironclad steamer Fingal, alias Atlanta,
      whilst in command of the United States ironclad steamer Weehawken, which
      led to her capture on the 17th June, 1863, and also for the zeal, bravery,
      and general good conduct shown by this officer on many occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the
      requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the
      following words, viz:
    </p>
    <p>
      That any line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps may be advanced one
      grade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the
      thanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the
      enemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.

      TO THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Congress, on my recommendation, passed a resolution, approved 7th
      February, 1863, tendering its thanks to Commander D. D. Porter "for the
      bravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas on the
      10th January, 1863," and in consideration of those services, together with
      his efficient labors and vigilance subsequently displayed in thwarting the
      efforts of the rebels to obstruct the Mississippi and its tributaries and
      the important part rendered by the squadron under his command, which led
      to the surrender of Vicksburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do therefore, in conformity to the seventh section of the act approved
      16th July, 1862, nominate Commander D. D. Porter to be a rear-admiral in
      the Navy on the active list from the 4th July, 1863, to fill an existing
      vacancy.

      PROCLAMATION CONCERNING DISCRIMINATING DUTIES, DECEMBER 16, 1863.

    <h3>
      BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th of May,
      1828, entitled "An act in addition to an act entitled 'An act concerning
      discriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to equalize the duties on
      Prussian vessels and their cargoes," it is provided that upon satisfactory
      evidence being given to the President of the United States by the
      government of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage
      or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon
      vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the
      produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United
      States or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to
      issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of
      tonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be suspended and
      discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation and
      the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States
      in the same from the said foreign nation or from any other foreign
      country, the said suspension to take effect from the time of such
      notification being given to the President of the United States and to
      continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to
      citizens of the United States and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be
      continued, and no longer; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me through an
      official communication of Senor Don Luis Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and
      Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Nicaragua, under date of the
      28th of November, 1863, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and
      impost have been imposed or levied since the second day of August, 1838,
      in the ports of Nicaragua, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of
      the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise
      imported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign country
      whatever, than are levied on Nicaraguan ships and their cargoes in the
      same ports under like circumstances:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of
      America, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts
      imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United
      States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects
      the vessels of Nicaragua, and the produce, manufactures, and the
      merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the dominions
      of Nicaragua, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said
      suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue
      thenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the
      United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported
      into the dominions of Nicaragua in the same, as aforesaid, shall be
      continued on the part of the government of Nicaragua.

    <p>
      HON. SECRETARY OF WAR.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;Sending a note to the Secretary of the Navy, as I
      promised, he called over and said that the strikes in the ship-yards had
      thrown the completion of vessels back so much that he thought General
      Gilimore's proposition entirely proper. He only wishes (and in which I
      concur) that General Gillmore will courteously confer with, and explain
      to, Admiral Dahlgren.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the Western matter, I believe the program will have to stand
      substantially as I first put it. Henderson, and especially Brown, believe
      that the social influence of St. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously
      upon General Pope in the particular difficulty existing there, and I think
      there is some force in that view.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to retaining General Schofield temporarily, if this should be done, I
      believe I should scarcely be able to get his nomination through the
      Senate. Send me over his nomination, which, however, I am not quite ready
      to send to the Senate.

      TO O. D. FILLEY.

    <h3>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 22, 1863.
    </h3>
    <p>
      O. D. FILLEY, ST. Louis, Missouri:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just looked over a petition signed by some three dozen citizens of
      St. Louis, and three accompanying letters, one by yourself, one by a Mr.
      Nathan Ranney, and one by a Mr. John D. Coalter, the whole relating to the
      Rev. Dr. McPheeters. The petition prays, in the name of justice and mercy,
      that I will restore Dr. McPheeters to all his ecclesiastical rights. This
      gives no intimation as to what ecclesiastical rights are withheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your letter states that Provost-Marshal Dick, about a year ago, ordered
      the arrest of Dr. McPheeters, pastor of the Vine Street Church, prohibited
      him from officiating, and placed the management of the affairs of the
      church out of the control of its chosen trustees; and near the close you
      state that a certain course "would insure his release." Mr. Ranney's
      letter says: "Dr. Samuel S. McPheeters is enjoying all the rights of a
      civilian, but cannot preach the Gospel!!!!" Mr. Coalter, in his letter,
      asks: "Is it not a strange illustration of the condition of things, that
      the question of who shall be allowed to preach in a church in St. Louis
      shall be decided by the President of the United States?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, all this sounds very strangely; and, withal, a little as if you
      gentlemen making the application do not understand the case alike; one
      affirming that the doctor is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, and
      another pointing out to me what will secure his release! On the second day
      of January last, I wrote to General Curtis in relation to Mr. Dick's order
      upon Dr. McPheeters; and, as I suppose the doctor is enjoying all the
      rights of a civilian, I only quote that part of my letter which relates to
      the church. It is as follows: "But I must add that the United States
      Government must not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When
      an individual, in a church or out of it, becomes dangerous to the public
      interest, he must be checked; but the churches, as such, must take care of
      themselves. It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees,
      supervisors, or other agents for the churches."
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter going to General Curtis, then in command there, I supposed, of
      course, it was obeyed, especially as I heard no further complaint from Dr.
      McPheeters or his friends for nearly an entire year. I have never
      interfered, nor thought of interfering, as to who shall or shall not
      preach in any church; nor have I knowingly or believingly tolerated any
      one else to so interfere by my authority. If any one is so interfering by
      color of my authority, I would like to have it specifically made known to
      me. If, after all, what is now sought is to have me put Dr. McPheeters
      back over the heads of a majority of his own congregation, that, too, will
      be declined. I will not have control of any church on any side.

    <p>
      GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
    </p>
    <p>
      By a joint resolution of your honorable bodies approved December 23, 1863,
      the paying of bounties to veteran volunteers, as now practiced by the War
      Department, is, to the extent of three hundred dollars in each case,
      prohibited after this 5th day of the present month. I transmit for your
      consideration a communication from the Secretary of War, accompanied by
      one from the Provost-Marshal General to him, both relating to the subject
      above mentioned. I earnestly recommend that the law be so modified as to
      allow bounties to be paid as they now are, at least until the ensuing 1st
      day of February.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not without anxiety lest I appear to be importunate in thus recalling
      your attention to a subject upon which you have so recently acted, and
      nothing but a deep conviction that the public interest demands it could
      induce me to incur the hazard of being misunderstood on this point. The
      Executive approval was given by me to the resolution mentioned, and it is
      now by a closer attention and a fuller knowledge of facts that I feel
      constrained to recommend a reconsideration of the subject.

    <p>
      Yours of yesterday received. Nothing is known here about General Foster's
      order, of which you complain, beyond the fair presumption that it comes
      from General Grant, and that it has an object which, if you understood,
      you would be loath to frustrate. True, these troops are, in strict law,
      only to be removed by my order; but General Grant's judgment would be the
      highest incentive to me to make such order. Nor can I understand how doing
      so is bad faith and dishonor, nor yet how it so exposes Kentucky to ruin.
      Military men here do not perceive how it exposes Kentucky, and I am sure
      Grant would not permit it if it so appeared to him.

      I understand an effort is being made by some worthy gentlemen to

      given Mr. Hay a commission of major, and sent him to you, with some
      blank-books and other blanks, to aid in the reconstruction. He will
      explain as to the manner of using the blanks, and also my general views on
      the subject. It is desirable for all to co-operate, but if irreconcilable
      differences of opinion shall arise, you are master. I wish the thing done
      in the most speedy way, so that when done it be within the range of the
      late proclamation on the subject. The detail labor will, of course, have
      to be done by others; but I will be greatly obliged if you will give it
      such general supervision as you can find consistent with your more
      strictly military duties.

    <p>
      GENTLEMEN: The number for this month and year of the North American Review
      was duly received, and for which please accept my thanks. Of course I am
      not the most impartial judge; yet, with due allowance for this, I venture
      to hope that the article entitled "The President's Policy" will be of
      value to the country. I fear I am not worthy of all which is therein
      kindly said of me personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence of twelve lines, commencing at the top of page 252, I could
      wish to be not exactly what it is. In what is there expressed, the writer
      has not correctly understood me. I have never had a theory that secession
      could absolve States or people from their obligations. Precisely the
      contrary is asserted in the inaugural address; and it was because of my
      belief in the continuation of those obligations that I was puzzled, for a
      time, as to denying the legal rights of those citizens who remained
      individually innocent of treason or rebellion. But I mean no more now than
      to merely call attention to this point.

      that election, and thenceforward, that the constitution and laws of the

      Assembly may make such provisions for the freed people as shall recognize
      and declare their permanent freedom, and provide for their education, and

      condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class; that said election
      shall be held on the 28th of March, 1864, at all the usual places of the
      State, or all such as voters may attend for that purpose, that the voters
      attending at eight o'clock in the morning of said day may choose judges

      clerks may make returns directly to you on or before the &mdash;th day of
      &mdash;&mdash; next; that in all other respects said election may be
      conducted according to said constitution and laws: that on receipt of said
      returns, when five thousand four hundred and six votes shall have been
      cast, you can receive said votes, and ascertain all who shall thereby
      appear to have been elected; that on the &mdash;th day of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

      THE STORY OF THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TOLD BY THE PRESIDENT, TO THE ARTIST F. B. CARPENTER,
    </h3>
    <p>
      FEBRUARY 6, 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It had got to be," said Mr. Lincoln, "midsummer, 1862. Things had gone on
      from bad to worse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on
      the plan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played our
      last card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game. I now determined
      upon the adoption of the emancipation policy; and without consultation
      with, or the knowledge of, the Cabinet, I prepared the original draft of
      the proclamation, and, after much anxious thought, called a Cabinet
      meeting upon the subject. This was the last of July or the first part of
      the month of August, 1862. [The exact date was July 22, 1862.]... All were
      present excepting Mr. Blair, the Postmaster-General, who was absent at the
      opening of the discussion, but came in subsequently. I said to the Cabinet
      that I had resolved upon this step, and had not called them together to
      ask their advice, but to lay the subject-matter of a proclamation before
      them, suggestions as to which would be in order after they had heard it
      read. Mr. Lovejoy was in error when he informed you that it excited no
      comment excepting on the part of Secretary Seward. Various suggestions
      were offered. Secretary Chase wished the language stronger in reference to
      the arming of the blacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Blair, after he came in, deprecated the policy on the ground that it
      would cost the administration the fall elections. Nothing, however, was
      offered that I had not already fully anticipated and settled in my mind,
      until Secretary Seward spoke. He said in substance, 'Mr. President, I
      approve of the proclamation, but I question the expediency of its issue at
      this juncture. The depression of the public mind, consequent upon our
      repeated reverses, is so great that I fear the effect of so important a
      step. It may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government, a
      cry for help; the government stretching forth its hands to Ethiopia,
      instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the government.' His
      idea," said the President, "was that it would be considered our last
      shriek on the retreat." [This was his precise expression.] 'Now,'
      continued Mr. Seward, 'while I approve the measure, I suggest, sir, that
      you postpone its issue until you can give it to the country supported by
      military success, instead of issuing it, as would be the case now, upon
      the greatest disasters of the war.' Mr. Lincoln continued "The wisdom of
      the view of the Secretary of State struck me with very great force. It was
      an aspect of the case that, in all my thought upon the subject, I had
      entirely overlooked. The result was that I put the draft of the
      proclamation aside, as you do your sketch for a picture, waiting for a
      victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From time to time I added or changed a line, touching it up here and
      there, anxiously watching the process of events. Well, the next news we
      had was of Pope's disaster at Bull Run. Things looked darker than ever.
      Finally came the week of the battle of Antietam. I determined to wait no
      longer. The news came, I think, on Wednesday, that the advantage was on
      our side. I was then staying at the Soldiers' Home [three miles out of
      Washington]. Here I finished writing the second draft of the preliminary
      proclamation; came up on Saturday; called the Cabinet together to hear it,
      and it was published on the following Monday."

      When I fixed a plan for an election in Arkansas I did it in ignorance that
      your convention was doing the same work. Since I learned the latter fact I
      have been constantly trying to yield my plan to them. I have sent two
      letters to General Steele, and three or four despatches to you and others,
      saying that he, General Steele, must be master, but that it will probably
      be best for him to merely help the convention on its own plan. Some single
      mind must be master, else there will be no agreement in anything, and
      General Steele, commanding the military and being on the ground, is the
      best man to be that master. Even now citizens are telegraphing me to
      postpone the election to a later day than either that fixed by the
      convention or by me. This discord must be silenced.

      PROCLAMATION CONCERNING BLOCKADE, FEBRUARY 18, 1864.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
    </h3>
    <p>
      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, by my proclamation of the nineteenth of April, one thousand eight
      hundred and sixty-one, the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia,
      Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas were, for reasons
      therein set forth, placed under blockade; and whereas, the port of
      Brownsville, in the district of Brazos Santiago, in the State of Texas,
      has since been blockaded, but as the blockade of said port may now be
      safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
      United States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section
      of the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled "An
      act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for
      other purposes," do hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of
      Brownsville shall so far cease and determine from and after this date,
      that commercial intercourse with said port, except as to persons, things,
      and information hereinafter specified, may, from this date, be carried on,
      subject to the laws of the United States, to the regulations prescribed by
      the Secretary of the Treasury, and, until the rebellion shall have been
      suppressed, to such orders as may be promulgated by the general commanding
      the department, or by an officer duly authorized by him and commanding at
      said port. This proclamation does not authorize or allow the shipment or
      conveyance of persons in, or intending to enter, the service of the
      insurgents, or of things or information intended for their use, or for
      their aid or comfort, nor, except upon the permission of the Secretary of
      War, or of some officer duly authorized by him, of the following
      prohibited articles, namely: cannon, mortars, firearms, pistols, bombs,
      grenades, powder, saltpeter, sulphur, balls, bullets, pikes, swords,
      boarding-caps (always excepting the quantity of the said articles which
      may be necessary for the defense of the ship and those who compose the
      crew), saddles, bridles, cartridge-bag material, percussion and other
      caps, clothing adapted for uniforms; sail-cloth of all kinds, hemp and
      cordage, intoxicating drinks other than beer and light native wines.
    </p>
    <p>
      To vessels clearing from foreign ports and destined to the port of
      Brownsville, opened by this proclamation, licenses will be granted by
      consuls of the United States upon satisfactory evidence that the vessel so
      licensed will convey no persons, property, or information excepted or
      prohibited above, either to or from the said port; which licenses shall be
      exhibited to the collector of said port immediately on arrival, and, if
      required, to any officer in charge of the blockade, and on leaving said
      port every vessel will be required to have a clearance from the collector
      of the customs, according to law, showing no violation of the conditions
      of the license. Any violations of said conditions will involve the
      forfeiture and condemnation of the vessel and cargo, and the exclusion of
      all parties concerned from any further privilege of entering the United
      States during the war for any purpose whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all respects, except as herein specified, the existing blockade remains
      in full force and effect as hitherto established and maintained, nor is it
      relaxed by this proclamation except in regard to the port to which
      relaxation is or has been expressly applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of
      the United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this
      eighteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
      hundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the
      eighty-eighth.

      WASHINGTON, February 27, 1864.

    <p>
      HON. E. H: EAST, Secretary of State, Nashville, Tennessee
    </p>
    <p>
      Your telegram of the twenty-sixth instant asking for a copy of my despatch
      to Warren Jordan, Esq., at Nashville Press office, has just been referred
      to me by Governor Johnson. In my reply to Mr. Jordan, which was brief and
      hurried, I intended to say that in the county and State elections of
      Tennessee, the oath prescribed in the proclamation of Governor Johnson on
      the twenty-sixth of January, 1864, ordering an election in Tennessee on
      the first Saturday in March next, is entirely satisfactory to me as a test
      of loyalty of all persons proposing or offering to vote in said elections;
      and coming from him would better be observed and followed. There is no
      conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation of eighth
      December, 1863, and that prescribed by Governor Johnson in his
      proclamation of the twenty-sixth ultimo.
    </p>
    <p>
      No person who has taken the oath of amnesty of eighth December, 1863, and
      obtained a pardon thereby, and who intends to observe the same in good
      faith, should have any objection to taking that prescribed by Governor
      Johnson as a test of loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen and examined Governor Johnson's proclamation, and am entirely
      satisfied with his plan, which is to restore the State government and
      place it under the control of citizens truly loyal to the Government of
      the United States.

      TO SECRETARY STANTON.

    <h3>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 27, 1864
    </h3>
    <p>
      HON. SECRETARY OF WAR.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR:&mdash;You ask some instructions from me in relation to the Report of
      Special Commission constituted by an order of the War Department, dated
      December 5, 1863, "to revise the enrolment and quotas of the City and
      State of New York, and report whether there be any, and what, errors or
      irregularities therein, and what corrections, if any, should be made."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the correspondence between the Governor of New York and myself last
      summer, I understood him to complain that the enrolments in several of the
      districts of that State had been neither accurately nor honestly made; and
      in view of this, I, for the draft then immediately ensuing, ordered an
      arbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the districts wherein they
      seemed too large, and said: "After this drawing, these four districts, and
      also the seventeenth and twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled,
      and, if you please, agents of yours may witness every step of the
      process." In a subsequent letter I believe some additional districts were
      put into the list of those to be re-enrolled. My idea was to do the work
      over according to the law, in presence of the complaining party, and
      thereby to correct anything which might be found amiss. The commission,
      whose work I am considering, seem to have proceeded upon a totally
      different idea. Not going forth to find men at all, they have proceeded
      altogether upon paper examinations and mental processes. One of their
      conclusions, as I understand, is that, as the law stands, and attempting
      to follow it, the enrolling officers could not have made the enrolments
      much more accurately than they did. The report on this point might be
      useful to Congress. The commission conclude that the quotas for the draft
      should be based upon entire population, and they proceed upon this basis
      to give a table for the State of New York, in which some districts are
      reduced and some increased. For the now ensuing draft, let the quotas
      stand as made by the enrolling officers, in the districts wherein this
      table requires them to be increased; and let them be reduced according to
      the table in the others: this to be no precedent for subsequent action.
      But, as I think this report may, on full consideration, be shown to have
      much that is valuable in it, I suggest that such consideration be given
      it, and that it be especially considered whether its suggestions can be
      conformed to without an alteration of the law.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I see your despatch of yesterday to the Secretary of War.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you would go to the Mississippi River at once, and take hold of and
      be master in the contraband and leasing business. You understand it better
      than any other man does. Mr. Miller's system doubtless is well intended,
      but from what I hear I fear that, if persisted in, it would fall dead
      within its own entangling details. Go there and be the judge. A Mr. Lewis
      will probably follow you with something from me on this subject, but do
      not wait for him. Nor is this to induce you to violate or neglect any
      military order from the General-in-Chief or Secretary of War.

    </h3>
    <p>
      HON. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;I would have taken time to answer yours of the 22d
      inst. sooner, only that I did not suppose any evil could result from the
      delay, especially as, by a note, I promptly acknowledged the receipt of
      yours, and promised a fuller answer. Now, on consideration I find there is
      really very little to say. My knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy's letter having
      been made public came to me only the day you wrote; but I had, in spite of
      myself, known of its existence several days before. I have not yet read
      it, and I think I shall not. I was not shocked or surprised by the
      appearance of the letter, because I had had knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy's
      committee, and of secret issues which, I supposed, came from it, and of
      secret agents who, I supposed, were sent out by it for several weeks. I
      have known just as little a these things as my friends have allowed me to
      know. They bring the documents to me, but I do not read them; they tell me
      what they think fit to tell me, but I do not inquire for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fully concur with you that neither of us can justly be held responsible
      for what our respective friends may do without our instigation or
      countenance and I assure you, as you have assured me, that no assault has
      been made upon you by my instigation, or with my countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you shall remain at the head of the Treasury Department is a
      question which I will not allow myself to consider from any standpoint
      other than my judgment of the public service, and, in that view, I do not
      perceive occasion for a change.

      This introduces Mr. Lewis, mentioned in my despatch sent you at Louisville
      some days ago. I have but little personal acquaintance with him; but he
      has the confidence of several members of Congress here who seem to know
      him well. He hopes to be useful, without charge to the government, in
      facilitating the introduction of the free-labor system on the Mississippi
      plantations. He is acquainted with, and has access to, many of the
      planters who wish to adopt the system. He will show you two letters of
      mine on this subject, one somewhat General, and the other relating to
      named persons; they are not different in principle. He will also show you
      some suggestions coming from some of the planters themselves. I desire
      that all I promise in these letters, so far as practicable, may be in good
      faith carried out, and that suggestions from the planters may be heard and
      adopted, so far as they may not contravene the principles stated, nor
      justice, nor fairness, to laborers. I do not herein intend to overrule
      your own mature judgment on any point.

      Whereas, by an Executive order of the 10th of November last permission was

      paid for prior to the 4th day of March, 1861; but whereas it was

      purchased subsequently to that date, which fact made it necessary to
      suspend the carrying into effect of the said order; but whereas, pursuant
      to mutual explanations, a satisfactory understanding upon the subject has
      now been reached, it is directed that the order aforesaid may be carried

    <p>
      I deem it proper to add that on the 17th day of November last an Executive
      order was made upon this subject and delivered to the vice-president of
      the Union Pacific Railroad Company, which fixed the point on the western
      boundary of the State of Iowa from which the company should construct
      their branch road to the one hundredth degree of west longitude, and
      declared it to be within the limits of the township in Iowa opposite the
      town of Omaha, in Nebraska. Since then the company has represented to me
      that upon actual surveys made it has determined upon the precise point of
      departure of their said branch road from the Missouri River, and located
      the same as described in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the
      Interior, which point is within the limits designated in the order of
      November last; and inasmuch as that order is not of record in any of the

      I have made the order of which a copy is herewith, and caused the same to

      In order to supply the force required to be drafted for the Navy and to
      provide an adequate reserve force for all contingencies, in addition to
      the five hundred thousand men called for February 1, 1864, a call is
      hereby made and a draft ordered for two hundred thousand men for the
      military service (Army, Navy, and Marine Corps) of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proportional quotas for the different wards, towns, townships,
      precincts, or election districts, or counties, will be made known through
      the Provost Marshal-General's Bureau, and account will be taken of the
      credits and deficiencies on former quotas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 15th day of April, 1864, is designated as the time up to which the
      numbers required from each ward of a city, town, etc., may be raised by
      voluntary enlistment, and drafts will be made in each ward of a city,
      town, etc., which shall not have filled the quota assigned to it within
      the time designated for the number required to fill said quotas. The
      drafts will be commenced as soon after the 15th of April as practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Government bounties as now paid continue until April I, 1864, at which

      REMARKS AT A FAIR IN THE PATENT OFFICE,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WASHINGTON, MARCH 16, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:
    </p>
    <p>
      I appear to say but a word. This extraordinary war in which we are engaged
      falls heavily upon all classes of people but the most heavily upon the
      soldier. For it has been said, "All that a man hath will he give for his
      life;" and while all contribute of their substance, the soldier puts his
      life at stake, and often yields it up in his country's cause. The highest
      merit, then, is due to the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this extraordinary war, extraordinary developments have manifested
      themselves, such as have not been seen in former wars; and among these
      manifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the
      relief of suffering soldiers and their families. And the chief agents of
      these fairs are the women of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not accustomed to the use of language of eulogy: I have never studied
      the art of paying compliments to women; but I must say, that if all that
      has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in
      praise of women were applied to the women of America, it would not do them
      justice for their conduct during this war. I will close by saying, God
      bless the women of America.

    <h2>
      REPLY TO A COMMITTEE FROM THE WORKINGMEN'S ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MARCH 21, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:
    </p>
    <p>
      The honorary membership in your association, as generously tendered, is
      gratefully accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      You comprehend, as your address shows, that the existing rebellion means
      more and tends to do more than the perpetuation of African slavery&mdash;that
      it is, in fact, a war upon the rights of all working people. Partly to
      show that this view has not escaped my attention, and partly that I cannot
      better express myself, I read a passage from the message to Congress in
      December, 1861:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not
      exclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government, the
      rights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most
      grave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the General
      tone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the abridgment of the
      existing right of suffrage, and the denial to the people of all right to
      participate in the selection of public officers, except the legislature,
      boldly advocated, with labored argument to prove that large control of the
      people in government is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself
      is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people.
      In my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit
      raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a General argument should be
      made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its
      connections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief
      attention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing, if not
      above labor, in the structure of government. It is assumed that labor is
      available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless
      somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to
      labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital
      shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent or
      buy them, and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so
      it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or
      what we call slaves. And, further, it is assumed that whoever is once a
      hired laborer, is fixed in that condition for life. Now there is no such
      relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thing
      as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer.
      Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are
      groundless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit
      of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.
      Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher
      consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection
      as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always
      will be, a relation between capital and labor, producing mutual benefits.
      The error is in assuming that the whole labor of a community exists within
      that relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves,
      and, with their capital, hire or buy another few to labor for them. A
      large majority belong to neither class&mdash;neither work for others, nor
      have others working for them. In most of the Southern States, a majority
      of the whole people, of all colors, are neither slaves nor masters; while
      in the Northern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with
      their families, wives, sons, and daughters&mdash;work for themselves, on
      their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product
      to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of
      hired laborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a
      considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital; that
      is, they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor
      for them, but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle
      stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such
      thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life.
      Many independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their
      lives, were hired laborers. The prudent penniless beginner in the world
      labors for wages a while, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land
      for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length
      hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and
      prosperous system which opens the way to all&mdash;gives hope to all, and
      consequent energy and progress, and improvement of condition to all. No
      men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from
      poverty&mdash;none less inclined to touch or take aught which they have
      not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power
      they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to
      close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new
      disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty shall be lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      The views then expressed remain unchanged, nor have I much to add. None
      are so deeply interested to resist the present rebellion as the working
      people. Let them beware of prejudices, working division and hostility
      among themselves. The most notable feature of a disturbance in your city
      last summer was the hanging of some working people by other working
      people. It should never be so. The strongest bond of human sympathy,
      outside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working people,
      of all nations, and tongues, and kindreds. Nor should this lead to a war
      upon property, or the owners of property. Property is the fruit of labor;
      property is desirable; is a positive good in the world. That some should
      be rich shows that others may become rich, and, hence, is just
      encouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless
      pull down the house of another, but let him labor diligently and build one
      for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from
      violence when built.

    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;Yours of February 29 reached me only four days ago; but
      the delay was of little consequence, because I found, on feeling around, I
      could not invite you here without a difficulty which at least would be
      unpleasant, and perhaps would be detrimental to the public service. Allow
      me to suggest that if you wish to remain in the military service, it is
      very dangerous for you to get temporarily out of it; because, with a
      major-general once out, it is next to impossible for even the President to
      get him in again. With my appreciation of your ability and correct
      principle, of course I would be very glad to have your service for the
      country in the approaching political canvass; but I fear we cannot
      properly have it without separating you from the military.

      PROCLAMATION ABOUT AMNESTY,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MARCH 26, 1864.

    <p>
      BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:
    </p>
    <p>
      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, it has become necessary to define the cases in which insurgent
      enemies are entitled to the benefits of the Proclamation of the President
      of the United States, which was made on the 8th day of December, 1863, and
      the manner in which they shall proceed to avail themselves of these
      benefits; and whereas the objects of that Proclamation were to suppress
      the insurrection and to restore the authority of the United States; and
      whereas the amnesty therein proposed by the President was offered with
      reference to these objects alone:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do
      hereby proclaim and declare that the said Proclamation does not apply to
      the cases of persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the
      benefits thereof by taking the oath thereby prescribed, are in military,
      naval, or civil confinement or custody, or under bonds, or on parole of
      the civil, military, or naval authorities, or agents of the United States,
      as prisoners of war, or persons detained for offences of any kind, either
      before or after conviction; and that on the contrary it does apply only to
      those persons who, being yet at large, and free from any arrest,
      confinement, or duress, shall voluntarily come forward and take the said
      oath, with the purpose of restoring peace, and establishing the national
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persons excluded from the amnesty offered in the said Proclamation may
      apply to the President for clemency, like all other offenders, and their
      application will receive due consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do further declare and proclaim that the oath presented in the aforesaid
      proclamation of the 8th of December, 1863, may be taken and subscribed
      before any commissioned officer, civil, military, or naval, in the service
      of the United States, or any civil or military officer of a State or
      Territory not in insurrection, who, by the laws thereof, may be qualified
      for administering oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      All officers who receive such oaths are hereby authorized to give
      certificates thereof to the persons respectively by whom they are made,
      and such officers are hereby required to transmit the original records of
      such oaths, at as early a day as may be convenient, to the Department of
      State, where they will be deposited, and remain in the archives of the
      Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary of State will keep a registry thereof, and will, on
      application, in proper cases, issue certificates of such records in the
      customary form of official certificates.

      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;The Governor of Kentucky is here, and desires to have

    <p>
      First. That the quotas of troops furnished, and to be furnished, by
      Kentucky may be adjusted upon the basis as actually reduced by able-bodied
      men of hers having gone into the rebel service; and that she be required
      to furnish no more than her just quotas upon fair adjustment upon such
      basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second. To whatever extent the enlistment and drafting, one or both, of
      colored troops may be found necessary within the State, it may be
      conducted within the law of Congress; and, so far as practicable, free
      from collateral embarrassments, disorders, and provocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think these requests of the Governor are reasonable; and I shall be
      obliged if you will give him a full hearing, and do the best you can to
      effect these objects.

    </h3>
    <p>
      A. G. HODGES, ESQ., Frankfort, Kentucky:
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;You ask me to put in writing the substance of what I
      verbally said the other day, in your presence, to Governor Bramlette and
      Senator Dixon. It was about as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I
      cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I have never
      understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to
      act officially upon this judgment and feeling. It was in the oath I took
      that I would to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the
      Constitution of the United States. I could not take the office without
      taking the oath. Nor was it my view that I might take an oath to get
      power, and break the oath in using the power. I understood, too, that in
      ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically
      indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery. I
      had publicly declared this many times, and in many ways. And I aver that,
      to this day, I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract
      judgment and feeling on slavery. I did understand, however, that my oath
      to preserve the Constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me
      the duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, that government,
      that nation, of which that Constitution was the organic law. Was it
      possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution? By General
      law, life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated
      to save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a limb. I felt
      that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful, by
      becoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution, through
      the preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and
      now avow it. I could not feel that to the best of my ability I had even
      tried to preserve the Constitution, if, to save slavery, or any minor
      matter, I should permit the wreck of government, country, and
      Constitution, altogether. When, early in the war, General Fremont
      attempted military emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then
      think it an indispensable necessity. When, a little later, General
      Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I
      objected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity. When,
      still later, General Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again
      forbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had
      come. When, in March, and May, and July, 1862, I made earnest and
      successive appeals to the Border States to favor compensated emancipation,
      I believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation and
      arming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure. They
      declined the proposition, and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the
      alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it the
      Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose
      the latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss, but of
      this I was not entirely confident. More than a year of trial now shows no
      loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment,
      none in our white military force, no loss by it any how, or anywhere. On
      the contrary, it shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand
      soldiers, seamen, and laborers. These are palpable facts, about which, as
      facts, there can be no caviling. We have the men; and we could not have
      had them without the measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now let any Union man who complains of the measure test himself by
      writing down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force of
      arms; and in the next, that he is for taking these hundred and thirty
      thousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they would be but
      for the measure he condemns. If he cannot face his case so stated, it is
      only because he cannot face the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      I add a word which was not in the verbal conversation. In telling this
      tale I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity. I claim not to have
      controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.
      Now, at the end of three years' struggle, the nation's condition is not
      what either party, or any man, devised or expected. God alone can claim
      it. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God now wills the removal of a
      great wrong, and wills also that we of the North, as well as you of the
      South, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial
      history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and
      goodness of God.

      LECTURE ON LIBERTY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ADDRESS AT SANITARY FAIR IN BALTIMORE,
    </h3>
    <p>
      APRIL 18, 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:&mdash;Calling to mind that we are in Baltimore, we
      cannot fail to note that the world moves. Looking upon these many people
      assembled here to serve, as they best may, the soldiers of the Union, it
      occurs at once that three years ago the same soldiers could not so much as
      pass through Baltimore. The change from then till now is both great and
      gratifying. Blessings on the brave men who have wrought the change, and
      the fair women who strive to reward them for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Baltimore suggests more than could happen within Baltimore. The change
      within Baltimore is part only of a far wider change. When the war began,
      three years ago, neither party, nor any man, expected it would last till
      now. Each looked for the end, in some way, long ere to-day. Neither did
      any anticipate that domestic slavery would be much affected by the war.
      But here we are; the war has not ended, and slavery has been much affected
      how much needs not now to be recounted. So true is it that man proposes
      and God disposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we can see the past, though we may not claim to have directed it; and
      seeing it, in this case, we feel more hopeful and confident for the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the
      American people, just now, are much in want of one. We all declare for
      liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing.
      With some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with
      himself, and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may
      mean for some men to do as they please with other men, and the product of
      other men's labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatible
      things, called by the same name, liberty. And it follows that each of the
      things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and
      incompatible names&mdash;liberty and tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep
      thanks the shepherd as his liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the
      same act, as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep was a black
      one. Plainly, the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of
      the word liberty; and precisely the same difference prevails to-day among
      us human creatures, even in the North, and all professing to love liberty.
      Hence we behold the process by which thousands are daily passing from
      under the yoke of bondage hailed by some as the advance of liberty, and
      bewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty. Recently, as it
      seems, the people of Maryland have been doing something to define liberty,
      and thanks to them that, in what they have done, the wolf's dictionary has
      been repudiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not very becoming for one in my position to make speeches at length;
      but there is another subject upon which I feel that I ought to say a word.
      A painful rumor, true, I fear, has reached us, of the massacre, by the
      rebel forces at Fort Pillow, in the west end of Tennessee, on the
      Mississippi River, of some three hundred colored soldiers and white
      officers [I believe it latter turned out to be 500], who had just been
      overpowered by their assailants [numbering 5000]. There seems to be some
      anxiety in the public mind whether the Government is doing its duty to the
      colored soldier, and to the service, at this point. At the beginning of
      the war, and for some time, the use of colored troops was not
      contemplated; and how the change of purpose was wrought I will not now
      take time to explain. Upon a clear conviction of duty I resolved to turn
      that element of strength to account; and I am responsible for it to the
      American people, to the Christian world, to history, and in my final
      account to God. Having determined to use the negro as a soldier, there is
      no way but to give him all the protection given to any other soldier. The
      difficulty is not in stating the principle, but in practically applying
      it. It is a mistake to suppose the Government is indifferent to this
      matter, or is not doing the best it can in regard to it. We do not to-day
      know that a colored soldier, or white officer commanding colored soldiers,
      has been massacred by the rebels when made a prisoner. We fear it, we
      believe it, I may say,&mdash;but we do not know it. To take the life of
      one of their prisoners on the assumption that they murder ours, when it is
      short of certainty that they do murder ours, might be too serious, too
      cruel, a mistake. We are having the Fort Pillow affair thoroughly
      investigated; and such investigation will probably show conclusively how
      the truth is. If after all that has been said it shall turn out that there
      has been no massacre at Fort Pillow, it will be almost safe to say there
      has been none, and will be none, elsewhere. If there has been the massacre
      of three hundred there, or even the tenth part of three hundred, it will
      be conclusively proved; and being so proved, the retribution shall as
      surely come. It will be matter of grave consideration in what exact course
      to apply the retribution; but in the supposed case it must come.
    </p>
    <p>
      [There was a massacre of a black company and their officers at Fort Pillow&mdash;they
      were prisoners who later on, the day of their capture, were ordered
      executed. The black soldiers were tied alive to individual planks&mdash;then
      man and plank were cobbled up like cord wood and burned. The white
      officers were shot. D.W.]

      relief. The military is doing and will continue to do the best for them
      within its power. Their address represents that the construction of direct
      railroad communication between Knoxville and Cincinnati by way of central
      Kentucky would be of great consequence in the present emergency. It may be
      remembered that in the annual message of December, 1861, such railroad
      construction was recommended. I now add that, with the hearty concurrence
      of Congress, I would yet be pleased to construct a road, both for the
      relief of these people and for its continuing military importance.

      MESSAGE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      APRIL 28, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
    </p>
    <p>
      In obedience to the resolution of your honorable body, a copy of which is
      herewith returned, I have the honor to make the following brief statement,
      which is believed to contain the information sought:
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to and at the meeting of the present Congress, Robert C. Schenck, of
      Ohio, and Frank P. Blair, Jr., of Missouri, members elect thereto, by and
      with the consent of the Senate held commissions from the Executive as
      major-generals in the volunteer army. General Schenck tendered the
      resignation of his said commission, and took his seat in the House of
      Representatives, at the assembling thereof, upon the distinct verbal
      understanding with the Secretary of War and the Executive that he might,
      at any time during the session, at his own pleasure, withdraw said
      resignation and return to the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Blair was, by temporary assignment of General Sherman, in command
      of a corps through the battles in front of Chattanooga, and in the march
      to the relief of Knoxville, which occurred in the latter days of November
      and early days of December last, and of course was not present at the
      assembling of Congress. When he subsequently arrived here, he sought, and
      was allowed by the Secretary of War and the Executive, the same conditions
      and promise as allowed and made to General Schenck.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Schenck has not applied to withdraw his resignation; but when
      General Grant was made Lieutenant-General, producing some change of
      commanders, General Blair sought to be assigned to the command of a corps.
      This was made known to Generals Grant and Sherman, and assented to by
      them, and the particular corps for him designated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all arranged and understood, as now remembered, so much as a
      month ago; but the formal withdrawal of General Blair's resignation, and
      making the order assigning him to the command of the corps, were not
      consummated at the War Department until last week, perhaps on the 23d of
      April instant. As a summary of the whole, it may be stated that General
      Blair holds no military commission or appointment other than as herein
      stated, and that it is believed he is now acting as major-General upon the
      assumed validity of the commission herein stated, in connection with the
      facts herein stated, and not otherwise. There are some letters, notes,
      telegrams, orders, entries, and perhaps other documents in connection with
      this subject, which it is believed would throw no additional light upon
      it, but which will be cheerfully furnished if desired.

      Not expecting to see you before the spring campaign opens, I wish to

      any restraints or constraints upon you. While I am very anxious that any
      great disaster or capture of our men in great number shall be avoided, I

    <p>
      Enough is known of army operations, within the last five days, to claim
      our special gratitude to God. While what remains undone demands our most
      sincere prayers to and reliance upon Him (without whom all effort is
      vain), I recommend that all patriots at their homes, in their places of
      public worship, and wherever they may be, unite in common thanksgiving and
      prayer to Almighty God.

      RESPONSE TO A SERENADE,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MAY 9, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      FELLOW-CITIZENS:&mdash;I am very much obliged to you for the compliment of
      this call, though I apprehend it is owing more to the good news received
      to-day from the Army, than to a desire to see me. I am indeed very
      grateful to the brave men who have been struggling with the enemy in the
      field, to their noble commanders who have directed them, and especially to
      our Maker. Our commanders are following up their victories resolutely and
      successfully. I think, without knowing the particulars of the plans of
      General Grant, that what has been accomplished is of more importance than
      at first appears. I believe, I know (and am especially grateful to know)
      that General Grant has not been jostled in his purposes, that he has made
      all his points, and to-day he is on his line as he purposed before he
      moved his armies. I will volunteer to say that I am very glad at what has
      happened, but there is a great deal still to be done. While we are
      grateful to all the brave men and officers for the events of the past few
      days, we should, above all, be very grateful to Almighty God, who gives us
      victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is enough yet before us requiring all loyal men and patriots to
      perform their share of the labor and follow the example of the modest
      General at the head of our armies, and sink all personal consideration for
      the sake of the country. I commend you to keep yourselves in the same
      tranquil mood that is characteristic of that brave and loyal man. I have
      said more than I expected when I came before you. Repeating my thanks for
      this call, I bid you good-bye.

      your own expense. While it seems inexpedient at this time to accept this

      garrison mentioned, I cannot pass unnoticed such a meritorious instance of
      individual patriotism. Permit me, for the Government, to express my

      is worthy of note among the many called forth in these times of national

      its historical statements, indorse the sentiments it expresses, and thank
      you in the nation's name for the sure promise it gives. Nobly sustained,
      as the Government has been, by all the churches, I would utter nothing

      it may fairly be said, that the Methodist Episcopal Church, not less
      devoted than the best, is by its greatest numbers the most important of
      all. It is no fault in others that the Methodist Church sends more
      soldiers to the field, more nurses to the hospitals, and more prayers to
      Heaven than&mdash;any other. God bless the Methodist Church Bless all the

      ORDER CONCERNING THE EXEMPTION OF AMERICAN CONSULS FROM MILITARY SERVICE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MAY 19, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is officially announced by the State Department that citizens of the
      United States holding commissions and recognized as Consuls of foreign
      powers, are not by law exempt from military service if drafted:
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the mere enrolment of a citizen holding a foreign consulate will
      not be held to vacate his commission, but if he shall be drafted his
      exequatur will be revoked unless he shall have previously resigned in
      order that another Consul may be received.
    </p>
    <p>
      An exequatur bearing date the 3d day of May, 1858, having been issued to
      Charles Hunt, a citizen of the United States, recognizing him as a Consul
      of Belgium for St. Louis, Missouri, and declaring him free to exercise and
      enjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are allowed to the Consuls
      of the most favored nations in the United States, and the said Hunt having
      sought to screen himself from his military duty to his country, in
      consequence of thus being invested with the consular functions of a
      foreign power in the United States, it is deemed advisable that the said
      Charles Hunt should no longer be permitted to continue in the exercise of
      said functions, powers, and privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are therefore to declare that I no longer recognize the said Hunt as
      Consul of Belgium, for St. Louis, Missouri, and will not permit him to
      exercise or enjoy any of the functions, powers or privileges allowed to
      consuls of that nation, and that I do hereby wholly revoke and annul the
      said exequatur heretofore given, and do declare the same to be absolutely
      null and void from this day forward.

      MEMORANDUM CONCERNING THE TRANSPORTATION OF THE NEW YORK NAVAL BRIGADE.

    </h3>
    <p>
      WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am again pressed with the claim of Mr. Marshall O. Roberts, for
      transportation of what was called the Naval Brigade from New York to
      Fortress Monroe. This force was a special organization got up by one
      Bartlett, in pretended pursuance of written authority from me, but in
      fact, pursuing the authority in scarcely anything whatever. The credit
      given him by Mr. Roberts, was given in the teeth of the express
      declaration that the Government would not be responsible for the class of
      expenses to which it belonged. After all some part of the transportation
      became useful to the Government, and equitably should be paid for; but I
      have neither time nor means to ascertain this equitable amount, or any
      appropriation to pay it with if ascertained. If the Quartermaster at New
      York can ascertain what would compensate for so much of the transportation
      as did result usefully to the Government, it might be a step towards
      reaching justice. I write this from memory, but I believe it is
      substantially correct.

      REPLY TO THE COMMITTEE NOTIFYING PRESIDENT LINCOLN OF HIS RENOMINATION,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JUNE 9, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:
    </p>
    <p>
      I will neither conceal my gratification nor restrain the expression of my
      gratitude that the Union people, through their convention, in their
      continued effort to save and advance the nation, have deemed me not
      unworthy to remain in my present position. I know no reason to doubt that
      I shall accept the nomination tendered; and yet perhaps I should not
      declare definitely before reading and considering what is called the
      platform. I will say now, however, I approve the declaration in favor of
      so amending the Constitution as to prohibit slavery throughout the nation.
      When the people in revolt, with a hundred days of explicit notice that
      they could within those days resume their allegiance without the overthrow
      of their institution, and that they could not so resume it afterward,
      elected to stand out, such amendment of the Constitution as now proposed
      became a fitting and necessary conclusion to the final success of the
      Union cause. Such alone can meet and cover all cavils. Now the
      unconditional Union men, North and South, perceive its importance and
      embrace it. In the joint names of Liberty and Union, let us labor to give
      it legal form and practical effect.

    <h2>
      PLATFORM OF THE UNION NATIONAL CONVENTION HELD IN BALTIMORE, MD., JUNE 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      AND 8, 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Resolved, That it is the highest duty of every American citizen to
      maintain against all their enemies the integrity of the Union and the
      paramount authority of the Constitution and laws of the United States; and
      that, laying aside all differences of political opinion, we pledge
      ourselves, as Union men, animated by a common sentiment and aiming at a
      common object, to do everything in our power to aid the Government in
      quelling by force of arms the rebellion now raging against its authority,
      and in bringing to the punishment due to their crimes the rebels and
      traitors arrayed against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Resolved, That we approve the determination of the Government of the
      United States not to compromise with rebels, or to offer them any terms of
      peace, except such as may be based upon an unconditional surrender of
      their hostility and a return to their just allegiance to the Constitution
      and laws of the United States, and that we call upon the Government to
      maintain this position, and to prosecute the war with the utmost possible
      vigor to the complete suppression of the rebellion, in full reliance upon
      the self-sacrificing patriotism, the heroic valor, and the undying
      devotion of the American people to their Country and its free
      institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Resolved, That as slavery was the cause, and now constitutes the
      strength, of this rebellion, and as it must be, always and everywhere,
      hostile to the principles of republican government, justice and the
      national safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil of
      the republic; and that while we uphold and maintain the acts and
      proclamations by which the Government, in its own defense, has aimed a
      death-blow at this gigantic evil, we are in favor, furthermore, of such an
      amendment to the Constitution, to be made by the people in conformity with
      its provisions, as shall terminate and forever prohibit the existence of
      slavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Resolved, That the thanks of the American people are due to the
      soldiers and sailors of the Army and Navy, who have periled their lives in
      defense of their country and in vindication of the honor of its flag; that
      the nation owes to them some permanent recognition of their patriotism and
      their valor, and ample and permanent provision for those of their
      survivors who have received disabling and honorable wounds in the service
      of the country; and that the memories of those who have fallen in its
      defense shall be held in grateful and everlasting remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Resolved, That we approve and applaud the practical wisdom, the
      unselfish patriotism, and the unswerving fidelity to the Constitution and
      the principles of American liberty, with which Abraham Lincoln has
      discharged under circumstances of unparalleled difficulty the great duties
      and responsibilities of the Presidential office; that we approve and
      indorse as demanded by the emergency and essential to the preservation of
      the nation, and as within the provisions of the Constitution, the measures
      and acts which he has adopted to defend the nation against its open and
      secret foes; that we approve, especially, the Proclamation of
      Emancipation, and the employment as Union soldiers of men heretofore held
      in slavery; and that we have full confidence in his determination to carry
      these and all other constitutional measures essential to the salvation of
      the country into full and complete effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Resolved, That we deem it essential to the General welfare that harmony
      should prevail in the national councils, and we regard as worthy of public
      confidence and official trust those only who cordially indorse the
      principles proclaimed in these resolutions, and which should characterize
      the administration of the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Resolved, That the Government owes to all men employed in its armies,
      without regard to distinction of color, the full protection of the laws of
      war, and that any violation of these laws, or of the usages of civilized
      nations in time of war, by the rebels now in arms, should be made the
      subject of prompt and full redress.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Resolved, That foreign immigration, which in the past has added so much
      to the wealth, development of resources, and increase of power to this
      nation, the asylum of the oppressed of all nations, should be fostered and
      encouraged by a liberal and just policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Resolved, That we are in favor of the speedy construction of the
      railroad to the Pacific coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Resolved, That the national faith, pledged for the redemption of the
      public debt, must be kept inviolate, and that for this purpose we
      recommend economy and rigid responsibility in the public expenditures, and
      a vigorous and just system of taxation: and that it is the duty of every
      loyal State to sustain the credit and promote the use of the national
      currency.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Resolved, That we approve the position taken by the Government that
      the people of the United States can never regard with indifference the
      attempt of any European power to overthrow by force or to supplant by
      fraud the institutions of any republican government on the Western
      Continent, and that they will view with extreme jealousy, as menacing to
      the peace and independence of their own country, the efforts of any such
      power to obtain new footholds for monarchical governments, sustained by
      foreign military force, in near proximity to the United States.

      GENTLEMEN&mdash;I can only say in response to the remarks of your
      chairman, that I am very grateful for the renewed confidence which has
      been accorded to me, both by the convention and by the National League. I
      am not insensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this, yet
      I do not allow myself to believe that any but a small portion of it is to
      be appropriated as a personal compliment to me. The convention and the
      nation, I am assured, are alike animated by a higher view of the interests
      of the country, for the present and the great future, and the part I am
      entitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part which I may lay
      hold of as being the opinion of the convention and of the League, that I
      am not entirely unworthy to be intrusted with the place I have occupied
      for the last three years. I have not permitted myself, gentlemen, to
      conclude that I am the best man in the country; but I am reminded in this
      connection of a story of an old Dutch farmer, who remarked to a companion
      once that "it was not best to swap horses when crossing a stream."

      I suppose that you have done me this kindness in connection with the
      action of the Baltimore convention, which has recently taken place, and
      with which, of course, I am very well satisfied. What we want still more

      General Grant. I propose that you constantly bear in mind that the support
      you owe to the brave officers and soldiers in the field is of the very

      SIR:&mdash;In every light in which the State of the Hawaiian Islands can

      fishermen, seamen, and other citizens, when on their lawful occasions they
      are navigating the eastern seas and oceans. Its people are free, and its
      laws, language, and religion are largely the fruit of our own teaching and
      example. The distinguished part which you, Mr. Minister, have acted in the

    <h2>
      ADDRESS AT A SANITARY FAIR IN PHILADELPHIA,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JUNE 16, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I suppose that this toast is intended to open the way for me to say
      something. War at the best is terrible, and this of ours in its magnitude
      and duration is one of the most terrible the world has ever known. It has
      deranged business totally in many places, and perhaps in all. It has
      destroyed property, destroyed life, and ruined homes. It has produced a
      national debt and a degree of taxation unprecedented in the history of
      this country. It has caused mourning among us until the heavens may almost
      be said to be hung in black. And yet it continues. It has had
      accompaniments not before known in the history of the world. I mean the
      Sanitary and Christian Commissions, with their labors for the relief of
      the soldiers, and the Volunteer Refreshment Saloons, understood better by
      those who hear me than by myself, and these fairs, first begun at Chicago
      and next held in Boston, Cincinnati, and other cities. The motive and
      object that lie at the bottom of them are worthy of the most that we can
      do for the soldier who goes to fight the battles of his country. From the
      fair and tender hand of women is much, very much, done for the soldier,
      continually reminding him of the care and thought for him at home. The
      knowledge that he is not forgotten is grateful to his heart. Another view
      of these institutions is worthy of thought. They are voluntary
      contributions, giving proof that the national resources are not at all
      exhausted, and that the national patriotism will sustain us through all.
      It is a pertinent question, When is this war to end? I do not wish to name
      the day when it will end, lest the end should not come at the given time.
      We accepted this war, and did not begin it. We accepted it for an object,
      and when that object is accomplished the war will end, and I hope to God
      that it will never end until that object is accomplished. We are going
      through with our task, so far as I am concerned, if it takes us three
      years longer. I have not been in the habit of making predictions, but I am
      almost tempted now to hazard one. I will. It is, that Grant is this
      evening in a position, with Meade and Hancock, of Pennsylvania, whence he
      can never be dislodged by the enemy until Richmond is taken. If I shall
      discover that General Grant may be greatly facilitated in the capture of
      Richmond by rapidly pouring to him a large number of armed men at the
      briefest notice, will you go? Will you march on with him? [Cries of "Yes,
      yes."] Then I shall call upon you when it is necessary.

    <p>
      HONORABLE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR:&mdash;By authority of the Constitution, and moved thereto by the
      fourth section of the act of Congress, entitled "An act making
      appropriations for the support of the army for the year ending the
      thirtieth of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, and for other
      purposes, approved June is, 1864," I require your opinion in writing as to
      what pay, bounty, and clothing are allowed by law to persons of color who
      were free on the nineteenth day of April, 1861, and who have been enlisted
      and mustered into the military service of the United States between the
      month of December, 1862, and the sixteenth of June, 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please answer as you would do, on my requirement, if the act of June 15,

      that act.

      LETTER ACCEPTING THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT.

    <h3>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, June 27, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      HON. WILLIAM DENNISON AND OTHERS, a Committee of the Union National
      Convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      GENTLEMEN:&mdash;Your letter of the 14th inst.., formally notifying me
      that I have been nominated by the convention you represent for the
      Presidency of the United States for four years from the 4th of March next,
      has been received. The nomination is gratefully accepted, as the
      resolutions of the convention, called the platform, are heartily approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the resolution in regard to the supplanting of republican government
      upon the Western Continent is fully concurred in, there might be
      misunderstanding were I not to say that the position of the Government in
      relation to the action of France in Mexico, as assumed through the State
      Department and indorsed by the convention among the measures and acts of
      the Executive, will be faithfully maintained so long as the state of facts
      shall leave that position pertinent and applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am especially gratified that the soldier and seaman were not forgotten
      by the convention, as they forever must and will be remembered by the
      grateful country for whose salvation they devote their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanking you for the kind and complimentary terms in which you have
      communicated the nomination and other proceedings of the convention, I
      subscribe myself,

      MAJOR-GENERAL STEELE:

    <p>
      I understand that Congress declines to admit to seats the persons sent as
      Senators and Representatives from Arkansas. These persons apprehend that,
      in consequence, you may not support the new State government there as you
      otherwise would. My wish is that you give that government and the people
      there the same support and protection that you would if the members had
      been admitted, because in no event, nor in any view of the case, can this
      do any harm, while it will be the best you can do toward suppressing the
      rebellion.

      To JOHN L. SCRIPPS, ESQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR SIR:&mdash;Complaint is made to me that you are using your official
      power to defeat Mr. Arnold's nomination to Congress. I am well satisfied
      with Mr. Arnold as a member of Congress, and I do not know that the man
      who might supplant him would be as satisfactory; but the correct
      principle, I think, is that all our friends should have absolute freedom
      of choice among our friends. My wish, therefore, is that you will do just
      as you think fit with your own suffrage in the case, and not constrain any
      of your subordinates to [do] other than [as] he thinks fit with his. This
      is precisely the rule I inculcated and adhered to on my part, when a
      certain other nomination, now recently made, was being canvassed for.

    <p>
      The President directs me to inform you that a rebel force, variously

      PROCLAMATION SUSPENDING THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JULY 5, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:
    </p>
    <p>
      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th day of April,
      1861, the President of the United States announced and declared that the
      laws of the United States had been for some time past, and then were,
      opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in certain States therein
      mentioned, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary
      course of judicial proceedings or by the power vested in the marshals by
      law; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation the land
      and naval forces of the United States were put into activity to suppress
      the said insurrections and rebellion; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, the Congress of the United States, by an act approved on the
      third day of March, 1863, did enact that during the said rebellion the
      President of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety
      may require it, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of
      habeas corpus in any case throughout the United States, or any part
      thereof; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, the said insurrection and rebellion still continue, endangering
      the existence of the Constitution and Government of the United States; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, the military forces of the United States are now actively engaged
      in suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion in various parts of the
      States where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing the
      laws and public authorities, especially in the States of Virginia and
      Georgia; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, on the fifteenth day of September last, the President of the
      United States duly issued his proclamation, wherein he declared that the
      privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be suspended throughout the
      United States, in Cases whereby the authority of the President of the
      United States, the military, naval, and civil officers of the United
      States, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their
      custody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the
      enemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted, or mustered,
      or enlisted in, or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United
      States, or as deserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law,
      or the rules and articles of war, or the rules and regulations prescribed
      for the military and naval service by authority of the President of the
      United States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offence against
      the military or naval service; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined the forces of
      the insurgents, who have on several occasions entered the said State of
      Kentucky in large force and not without aid and comfort furnished by
      disaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States residing therein,
      have not only greatly disturbed the public peace but have overborne the
      civil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and
      life in various parts of the State; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, it has been made known to the President of the United States, by
      the officers commanding the National armies, that combinations have been
      formed in the said State of Kentucky, with a purpose of inciting the rebel
      forces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said State,
      and thereby to embarrass the United States armies now operating in the
      said States of Virginia and Georgia, and even to endanger their safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by
      virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws, do
      hereby declare that in my judgment the public safety especially requires
      that the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus so
      proclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th of September, 1863, be
      made effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said State of
      Kentucky, and that martial law be for the present declared therein. I do
      therefore hereby require of the military officers of the said State that
      the privilege of the habeas corpus be effectually suspended within the
      said State, according to the aforesaid proclamation, and that martial law
      be established therein to take effect from the date of this proclamation,
      the said suspension and establishment of martial law to continue until
      this proclamation shall be revoked or modified, but not beyond the period
      when the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end. And
      I do hereby require and command, as well as military officers, all civil
      officers and authorities existing or found within the said State of
      Kentucky, to take notice of this proclamation and to give full effect to
      the same. The martial laws herein proclaimed and the things in that
      respect herein ordered will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the
      holding of lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional
      Legislature of Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in the
      courts of law existing therein between citizens of the United States in
      suits or proceedings which do not affect the military operations or the
      constituted authorities of the government of the United States.

      In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of
      the United States to be affixed.

      PROCLAMATION FOR A DAY OF PRAYER, JULY 7, 1864.

    <p>
      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, the Senate and House of Representatives at their last session
      adopted a concurrent resolution, which was approved on the second day of
      July instant, and which `was in the words following, namely:
    </p>
    <p>
      That the President of the United States be requested to appoint a day of
      humiliation and prayer by the people of the United States, that he request
      his constitutional advisers at the head of the Executive Departments to
      unite with him, as Chief Magistrate of the nation, at the City of
      Washington, and the members of Congress, and all magistrates, all civil,
      military, and naval officers, all soldiers, sailors, and marines, with all
      loyal and law-abiding people, to convene at their usual places of worship,
      or wherever they may be, to confess and to repent of their manifold sins,
      to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the Almighty, that, if
      consistent with His will, the existing rebellion may be speedily
      suppressed, and the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United
      States may be established throughout all the States; to implore Him, as
      the Supreme Ruler of the world, not to destroy us as a people, nor suffer
      us to be destroyed by the hostility or connivance of other nations, or by
      obstinate adhesion to our own counsels which may be in conflict with His
      eternal, purposes, and to implore Him to enlighten the mind of the nation
      to know and do His will, humbly believing that it is in accordance with
      His will that our place should be maintained as a united people among the
      family of nations; to implore Him to grant to our armed defenders, and the
      masses of the people, that courage, power of resistance, and endurance
      necessary to secure that result; to implore Him in His infinite goodness
      to soften the hearts, enlighten the minds, and quicken the conscience of
      those in rebellion, that they may lay down their arms, and speedily return
      to their allegiance to the United States, that they may not be utterly
      destroyed, that the effusion of blood may be stayed, and that unity and
      fraternity may be restored, and peace established throughout all our
      borders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the `United States,
      cordially concurring with the Congress of the United States, in the
      penitential and pious sentiments expressed in the aforesaid resolutions,
      and heartily approving of the devotional design and purpose thereof, do
      hereby appoint the first Thursday of August next to be observed by the
      people of the United States as a day of national humiliation and prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do hereby further invite and request the heads of the Executive
      Departments of this Government, together with all legislators, all judges
      and magistrates, and all other persons exercising authority in the land,
      whether civil, military, or naval, and all soldiers, seamen, and marines
      in the national service, and all other loyal and law-abiding people of the
      United States, to assemble in their preferred places of public worship on
      that day, and there to render to the Almighty and merciful Ruler of the
      Universe, such homage and such confessions, and to offer to Him such
      supplications as the Congress of the United States have, in their

      PROCLAMATION CONCERNING A BILL "TO GUARANTEE TO CERTAIN STATES,
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHOSE GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN USURPED OR OVERTHROWN, A REPUBLICAN FORM OF
      GOVERNMENT," AND CONCERNING RECONSTRUCTION,
    </p>
    <p>
      JULY 8, 1864. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:
    </p>
    <p>
      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas at the late session Congress passed a bill "to guarantee to
      certain states whose governments have been usurped or overthrown a
      republican form of government," a copy of which is hereunto annexed; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, the said bill was presented to the President of the United States
      for his approval less than one hour before the sine die adjournment of
      said session, and was not signed by him; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the said bill contains, among other things, a plan for restoring
      the States in rebellion to their proper practical relation in the Union,
      which plan expresses the sense of Congress upon that subject, and which
      plan it is now thought fit to lay before the people for their
      consideration:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do
      proclaim, declare, and make known that while I am (as I was in December
      last, when, by proclamation, I propounded a plan for restoration)
      unprepared by a formal approval of this bill to be inflexibly committed to
      any single plan of restoration, and while I am also unprepared to declare
      that the free State constitutions and governments already adopted and
      installed in Arkansas and Louisiana shall be set aside and held for
      naught, thereby repelling and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set
      up the same as to further effort, or to declare a constitutional
      competency in Congress to abolish slavery in States, but am at the same
      time sincerely hoping and expecting that a constitutional amendment
      abolishing slavery throughout the nation may be adopted, nevertheless I am
      fully satisfied with the system for restoration contained in the bill as
      one very proper plan for the loyal people of any State choosing to adopt
      it, and that I am and at all times shall be prepared to give the Executive
      aid and assistance to any such people so soon as the military resistance
      to the United States shall have been suppressed in any such States and the
      people thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the
      Constitution and the laws of the United States, in which cases
      militia-governors will be appointed with directions to proceed according
      to the bill.
    </p>

      LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.:

    <p>
      Your dispatch to General Halleck, referring to what I may think in the
      present emergency, is shown me. General Halleck says we have absolutely no
      force here fit to go to the field. He thinks that with the hundred-day men
      and invalids we have here we can defend Washington, and, scarcely,
      Baltimore. Besides these there are about eight thousand, not very
      reliable, under Howe, at Harper's Ferry with Hunter approaching that point
      very slowly, with what number I suppose you know better than I. Wallace,
      with some odds and ends, and part of what came up with Ricketts, was so
      badly beaten yesterday at Monocacy, that what is left can attempt no more
      than to defend Baltimore. What we shall get in from Pennsylvania and New
      York will scarcely be worth counting, I fear. Now, what I think is, that
      you should provide to retain your hold where you are, certainly, and bring
      the rest with you personally, and make a vigorous effort to destroy the
      enemy's forces in this vicinity. I think there is really a fair chance to
      do this, if the movement is prompt. This is what I think upon your
      suggestion, and is not an order.

      Yours of this morning received. You misconceive. The order you complain of
      was only nominally mine, and was framed by those who really made it with
      no thought of making you a scapegoat. It seemed to be General Grant's wish
      that the forces under General Wright and those under you should join and
      drive at the enemy under General Wright. Wright had the larger part of the
      force, but you had the rank. It was thought that you would prefer Crook's
      commanding your part to your serving in person under Wright. That is all
      of it. General Grant wishes you to remain in command of the department,

      I have seen your despatches objecting to agents of Northern States opening
      recruiting stations near your camps. An act of Congress authorizes this,
      giving the appointment of agents to the States, and not to the Executive
      Government. It is not for the War Department, or myself, to restrain or
      modify the law, in its execution, further than actual necessity may
      require. To be candid, I was for the passage of the law, not apprehending
      at the time that it would produce such inconvenience to the armies in the
      field as you now cause me to fear. Many of the States were very anxious
      for it, and I hoped that, with their State bounties, and active exertions,
      they would get out substantial additions to our colored forces, which,
      unlike white recruits, help us where they come from, as well as where they
      go to. I still hope advantage from the law; and being a law, it must be
      treated as such by all of us. We here will do what we consistently can to
      save you from difficulties arising out of it. May I ask, therefore, that
      you will give your hearty co-operation.

    <p>
      BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:
    </p>
    <p>
      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas by the act approved July 4, 1864, entitled "An act further to
      regulate and provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces
      and for other purposes," it is provided that the President of the United
      States may, "at his discretion, at any time hereafter, call for any number
      of men, as volunteers for the respective terms of one, two, and three
      years for military service," and "that in case the quota or any part
      thereof of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct, or election
      district, or of a county not so subdivided, shall not be filled within the
      space of fifty days after such call, then the President shall immediately
      order a draft for one year to fill such quota or any part thereof which
      may be unfilled;" and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the new enrolment heretofore ordered is so far completed as that
      the aforementioned act of Congress may now be put in operation for
      recruiting and keeping up the strength of the armies in the field, for
      garrisons, and such military operations as may be required for the purpose
      of suppressing the rebellion and restoring the authority of the United
      States Government in the insurgent States:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do
      issue this my last call for five hundred thousand volunteers for the
      military service: Provided, nevertheless, That this call shall be reduced
      by all credits which may be established under section eight of the
      aforesaid act on account of persons who have entered the naval service
      during the present rebellion and by credits for men furnished to the
      military service in excess of calls heretofore made. Volunteers will be
      accepted under this call for one, two, or three years, as they may elect,
      and will be entitled to the bounty provided by the law for the period of
      services for which they enlist.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I hereby proclaim, order, and direct that immediately after the 5th
      day of September, 1864, being fifty days from the date of this call, a
      draft for troops to serve for one year shall be had in every town,
      township, ward of a city, precinct, or election district, or county not so
      subdivided, to fill the quota which shall be assigned to it under this
      call or any part thereof which may be unfilled by volunteers on the said
      5th day of September, 1864.

    <p>
      SIR:&mdash;According to the request contained in your note, I have placed
      Mr. Gibson's letter of resignation in the hands of the President. He has
      read the letter, and says he accepts the resignation, as he will be glad
      to do with any other, which may be tendered, as this is, for the purpose
      of taking an attitude of hostility against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He says he was not aware that he was so much indebted to Mr. Gibson for
      having accepted the office at first, not remembering that he ever pressed
      him to do so, or that he gave it otherwise than as was usual, upon request
      made on behalf of Mr. Gibson.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thanks Mr. Gibson for his acknowledgment that he has been treated with
      personal kindness and consideration, and says he knows of but two small
      drawbacks upon Mr. Gibson's right to still receive such treatment, one of
      which is that he never could learn of his giving much attention to the
      duties of his office, and the other is this studied attempt of Mr.
      Gibson's to stab him.
    </p>

      MAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, near Atlanta:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just seen yours complaining of the appointment of Hovey and
      Osterhaus. The point you make is unquestionably a good one, and yet please
      hear a word from us. My recollection is that both General Grant and
      yourself recommended both H [ovey] and O [sterhaus] for promotion, and
      these, with other strong recommendations, drew committals from us which we
      could neither honorably or safely disregard. We blamed H [ovey] for coming
      away in the manner in which he did, but he knew he had apparent reason to
      feel disappointed and mortified, and we felt it was not best to crush one
      who certainly had been a good soldier. As to [Osterhaus], we did not know
      of his leaving at the time we made the appointment, and do not now know
      the terms on which he left. Not to have appointed him, as the case
      appeared to us at the time, would have been almost, if not quite, a
      violation of our word. The word was given on what we thought was high
      merit and somewhat on his nationality. I beg you to believe we do not act
      in a spirit of disregarding merit. We expect to await your programme for
      further changes and promotions in your army. My profoundest thanks to you
      and your whole army for the present campaign so far.

      INTERVIEW WITH JOHN T. MILLS,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AUGUST [15?], 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Mr. President," said Governor Randall, "why can't you seek seclusion, and
      play hermit for a fortnight? It would reinvigorate you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the President, "two or three weeks would do me no good. I
      cannot fly from my thoughts&mdash;my solicitude for this great country
      follows me wherever I go. I do not think it is personal vanity or
      ambition, though I am not free from these infirmities, but I cannot but
      feel that the weal or woe of this great nation will be decided in
      November. There is no program offered by any wing of the Democratic party
      but that must result in the permanent destruction of the Union."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mr. President, General McClellan is in favor of crushing out this
      rebellion by force. He will be the Chicago candidate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, the slightest knowledge of arithmetic will prove to any man that the
      rebel armies cannot be destroyed by Democratic strategy. It would
      sacrifice all the white men of the North to do it. There are now in the
      service of the United States nearly one hundred and fifty thousand
      able-bodied colored men, most of them under arms, defending and acquiring
      Union territory. The Democratic strategy demands that these forces be
      disbanded, and that the masters be conciliated by restoring them to
      slavery. The black men who now assist Union prisoners to escape are to be
      converted into our enemies, in the vain hope of gaining the good-will of
      their masters. We shall have to fight two nations instead of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot conciliate the South if you guarantee to them ultimate
      success; and the experience of the present war proves their success is
      inevitable if you fling the compulsory labor of millions of black men into
      their side of the scale. Will you give our enemies such military
      advantages as insure success, and then depend on coaxing, flattery, and
      concession to get them back into the Union? Abandon all the posts now
      garrisoned by black men, take one hundred and fifty thousand men from our
      side and put them in the battle-field or corn-field against us, and we
      would be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have to hold territory in inclement and sickly places; where are the
      Democrats to do this? It was a free fight, and the field was open to the
      war Democrats to put down this rebellion by fighting against both master
      and slave, long before the present policy was inaugurated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There have been men base enough to propose to me to return to slavery the
      black warriors of Port Hudson and Olustee, and thus win the respect of the
      masters they fought. Should I do so, I should deserve to be damned in time
      and eternity. Come what will, I will keep my faith with friend and foe. My
      enemies pretend I am now carrying on this war for the sole purpose of
      abolition. So long as I am President, it shall be carried on for the sole
      purpose of restoring the Union. But no human power can subdue this
      rebellion without the use of the emancipation policy, and every other
      policy calculated to weaken the moral and physical forces of the
      rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Freedom has given us one hundred and fifty thousand men, raised on
      Southern soil. It will give us more yet. Just so much it has subtracted
      from the enemy, and, instead of alienating the South, there are now
      evidences of a fraternal feeling growing up between our men and the rank
      and file of the rebel soldiers. Let my enemies prove to the country that
      the destruction of slavery is not necessary to a restoration of the Union.
      I will abide the issue."

      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;I have proposed to Mr. Greeley that the Niagara
      correspondence be published, suppressing only the parts of his letters
      over which the red pencil is drawn in the copy which I herewith send. He
      declines giving his consent to the publication of his letters unless these
      parts be published with the rest. I have concluded that it is better for
      me to submit, for the time, to the consequences of the false position in
      which I consider he has placed me, than to subject the country to the
      consequences of publishing these discouraging and injurious parts. I send
      you this, and the accompanying copy, not for publication, but merely to
      explain to you, and that you may preserve them until their proper time
      shall come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly,
    </p>

    <p>
      A Proclamation.

    <p>
      Whereas the act of Congress of the 28th of September, 1850, entitled "An
      act to create additional collection districts in the State of California,
      and to change the existing districts therein, and to modify the existing
      collection districts in the United States," extends to merchandise
      warehoused under bond the privilege of being exported to the British North
      American provinces adjoining the United States, in the manner prescribed
      in the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1845, which designates certain
      frontier ports through which merchandise may be exported, and further
      provides "that such other ports, situated on the frontiers of the United
      States adjoining the British North American provinces, as may hereafter be
      found expedient, may have extended to them the like privileges, on the
      recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, and proclamation duly
      made by the President of the United States, specially designating the
      ports to which the aforesaid privileges are to be extended."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of
      America, in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary of the
      Treasury, do hereby declare and proclaim that the port of Newport, in the
      State of Vermont, is and shall be entitled to all the privileges in regard
      to the exportation of merchandise in bond to the British North American
      provinces adjoining the United States, which are extended to the ports
      enumerated in the seventh section of the act of Congress of the 3d of
      March, 1845, aforesaid, from and after the date of this proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the
      United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this
      eighteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight

    <h3>
      AUGUST 18, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      SOLDIERS:&mdash;You are about to return to your homes and your friends,
      after having, as I learn, performed in camp a comparatively short term of
      duty in this great contest. I am greatly obliged to you, and to all who
      have come forward at the call of their country. I wish it might be more
      generally and universally understood what the country is now engaged in.
      We have, as all will agree, a free government, where every man has a right
      to be equal with every other man. In this great struggle, this form of
      government and every form of human right is endangered if our enemies
      succeed. There is more involved in this contest than is realized by every
      one. There is involved in this struggle, the question whether your
      children and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed. I say
      this, in order to impress upon you, if you are not already so impressed,
      that no small matter should divert us from our great purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may be some inequalities in the practical application of our system.
      It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value
      of his property; but if we should wait, before collecting a tax, to adjust
      the taxes upon each man in exact proportion with every other man, we
      should never collect any tax at all. There may be mistakes made sometimes;
      and things may be done wrong, while the officers of the Government do all
      they can to prevent mistakes. But I beg of you, as citizens of this great
      Republic, not to let your minds be carried off from the great work we have
      before us. This struggle is too large for you to be diverted from it by
      any small matter. When you return to your homes, rise up to the height of
      a generation of men worthy of a free government, and we will carry out the
      great work we have commenced. I return to you my sincere thanks, soldiers,
      for the honor you have done me this afternoon.

    <p>
      SOLDIERS&mdash;I suppose you are going home to see your families and
      friends. For the services you have done in this great struggle in which we
      are engaged, I present you sincere thanks for myself and the country.

    <p>
      I almost always feel inclined, when I say anything to soldiers, to impress
      upon them, in a few brief remarks, the importance of success in this
      contest. It is not merely for the day, but for all time to come, that we
      should perpetuate for our children's children that great and free
      government which we have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you to remember
      this, not merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen, temporarily, to
      occupy this big White House. I am a living witness that any one of your
      children may look to come here as my father's child has. It is in order
      that each one of you may have, through this free government which we have
      enjoyed, an open field, and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise,
      and intelligence; that you may all have equal privileges in the race of
      life with all its desirable human aspirations&mdash;it is for this that
      the struggle should be maintained, that we may not lose our birthrights&mdash;not
      only for one, but for two or three years, if necessary. The nation is
      worth fighting for, to secure such an inestimable jewel.

      SIR: It is represented to me that there are at Rock Island, Illinois, as
      rebel prisoners of war, many persons of Northern and foreign birth who are
      unwilling to be exchanged and sent South, but who wish to take the oath of
      allegiance and enter the military service of the Union. Colonel
      Huidekoper, on behalf of the people of some parts of Pennsylvania, wishes
      to pay the bounties the Government would have to pay to proper persons of
      this class, have them enter the service of the United States, and be
      credited to the localities furnishing the bounty money. He will therefore
      proceed to Rock Island, ascertain the names of such persons (not including
      any who have attractions Southward), and telegraph them to the
      Provost-Marshal-General here, whereupon direction will be given to
      discharge the persons named upon their taking the oath of allegiance; and
      then upon the official evidence being furnished that they shall have been
      duly received and mustered into the service of the United States, their
      number will be credited as may be directed by Colonel Huidekoper.

    </h3>
    <p>
      The signal success that Divine Providence has recently vouchsafed to the
      operations of the United States fleet and army in the harbor of Mobile,
      and the reduction of Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and Fort Morgan, and the
      glorious achievements of the army under Major-General Sherman, in the
      State of Georgia, resulting in the capture of the city of Atlanta, call
      for devout acknowledgment to the Supreme Being in whose hands are the
      destinies of nations. It is therefore requested that on next Sunday, in
      all places of worship in the United States, thanksgivings be offered to
      Him for His mercy in preserve our national existence against the insurgent
      rebels who have been waging a cruel war against the Government of the
      United States for its overthrow, and also that prayer be made for Divine
      protection to our brave soldiers and their leaders in the field who have
      so often and so gallantly periled their lives in battling with the enemy,
      and for blessings and comfort from the Father of mercies to the sick,
      wounded, and prisoners, and to the orphans and widows of those who have
      fallen in the service of their country, and that He will continue to

      the very impressive occasion when yourself and friends visited me on a
      Sabbath forenoon two years ago&mdash;nor has your kind letter, written
      nearly a year later, even been for gotten. In all, it has been your
      purpose to strengthen my reliance on God. I am much indebted to the good
      Christian people of the country for their constant prayer and
      consolations; and to no one of them, more than to yourself. The purposes
      of the Almighty are perfect, and must prevail, though we erring mortals
      may fail to accurately perceive them in advance. We hoped for a happy
      termination of this terrible war long before this; but God knows best, and
      has ruled otherwise. We shall yet acknowledge His wisdom, and our own
      error therein. Mean while we must work earnestly in the best light He
      gives us, trusting that so working still conduces to the great ends He
      ordains. Surely He intends some great good to follow this mighty
      convulsion, which no mortal could make, and no mortal could stay.

      Your people&mdash;the Friends&mdash;have had, and are having, a very great

      can only practically oppose oppression by war. For those appealing to me
      on conscientious grounds, I have done, and shall do, the best I could and
      can, in my own conscience, under my oath to the law. That you believe this
      I doubt not, and believing it, I shall still receive, for our country and

      ORDER OF THANKS TO HUNDRED-DAY TROOPS FROM OHIO.

    <p>
      The term of one hundred days for which the National Guard of Ohio
      volunteered having expired, the President directs an official
      acknowledgment to be made of their patriotic and valuable services during
      the recent campaigns. The term of service of their enlistment was short,
      but distinguished by memorable events. In the Valley of the Shenandoah, on
      the Peninsula, in the operations on the James River, around Petersburg and
      Richmond, in the battle of Monocacy, and in the intrenchments of
      Washington, and in other important service, the National Guard of Ohio
      performed with alacrity the duty of patriotic volunteers, for which they
      are entitled to and are hereby tendered, through the Governor of their
      State, the national thanks.

    <p>
      The State election of Indiana occurs on the 11th of October, and the loss
      of it to the friends of the Government would go far towards losing the
      whole Union cause. The bad effect upon the November election, and
      especially the giving the State government to those who will oppose the
      war in every possible way, are too much to risk if it can be avoided. The
      draft proceeds, notwithstanding its strong tendency to lose us the State.
      Indiana is the only important State voting in October whose soldiers
      cannot vote in the field. Anything you can safely do to let her soldiers
      or any part of them go home and vote at the State election will be greatly
      in point. They need not remain for the Presidential election, but may
      return to you at once. This is in no sense an order, but is merely
      intended to impress you with the importance to the Army itself of your
      doing all you safely can, yourself being the judge of what you can safely
      do.

      I send this as an explanation to you, and to do justice to the Secretary
      of War. I was induced, upon pressing application, to authorize the agents
      of one of the districts of Pennsylvania to recruit in one of the prison
      depots in Illinois; and the thing went so far before it came to the
      knowledge of the Secretary that, in my judgment, it could not be abandoned
      without greater evil than would follow its going through. I did not know
      at the time that you had protested against that class of thing being done;
      and I now say that while this particular job must be completed, no other
      of the sort will be authorized, without an understanding with you, if at
      all. The Secretary of War is wholly free of any part in this blunder.

      their respective governors, in the months of May and June, to aid in the

      over the rebel forces in Georgia under command of Johnston and Hood. On

      EXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, October 10, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      HON. HENRY W. HOFFMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;A convention of Maryland has framed a new constitution
      for the State; a public meeting is called for this evening at Baltimore to
      aid in securing its ratification by the people, and you ask a word from me
      for the occasion. I presume the only feature of the instrument about which
      there is serious controversy is that which provides for the extinction of
      slavery. It needs not to be a secret and I presume it is no secret, that I
      wish success to this provision. I desire it on every consideration. I wish
      all men to be free. I wish the material prosperity of the already free,
      which I feel sure the extinction of slavery would bring. I wish to see in
      process of disappearing that only thing which ever could bring this nation
      to civil war. I attempt no argument. Argument upon the question is already
      exhausted by the abler, better informed, and more immediately interested
      sons of Maryland herself. I only add that I shall be gratified exceedingly
      if the good people of the State shall, by their votes, ratify the new
      constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly,

      RESPONSE TO A SERENADE,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      OCTOBER 19, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:&mdash;I am notified that this is a compliment
      paid me by the loyal Marylanders resident in this District. I infer that
      the adoption of the new constitution for the State furnishes the occasion,
      and that in your view the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief
      merit of the new constitution. Most heartily do I congratulate you, and
      Maryland, and the nation, and the world, upon this event. I regret that it
      did not occur two years sooner, which, I am sure, would have saved the
      nation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to the
      measure; but it has come at last, and I sincerely hope its friends may
      fully realize all their anticipations of good from it, and that its
      opponents may by its effects be agreeably and profitably disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word upon another subject. Something said by the Secretary of State in
      his recent speech at Auburn, has been construed by some into a threat,
      that if I shall be beaten at the election, I will, between then and the
      end of my constitutional term, do what I may be able to ruin the
      Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others regard the fact that the Chicago Convention adjourned, not sine
      die, but to meet again, if called to do so by a particular individual, as
      the intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected he will
      at once seize control of the Government. I hope the good people will
      permit themselves to suffer no uneasiness on either point. I am struggling
      to maintain the Government, not to overthrow it. I am struggling
      especially to prevent others from overthrowing it. I therefore say, that
      if I live, I shall remain President until the 4th of next March, and that
      whoever shall be constitutionally elected, in November, shall be duly
      installed as President on the 4th of March, and in the interval I shall do
      my utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage shall start
      with the best possible chance of saving the ship. This is due to the
      people, both on principle and under the Constitution. Their will,
      constitutionally expressed, is the ultimate law for all. If they should
      deliberately resolve to have immediate peace, even at the loss of their
      country and their liberties, I know not the power or the right to resist
      them. It is their own business, and they must do as they please with their
      own. I believe, however, they are still resolved to preserve their country
      and their liberties; and in this, in office or out of it, I am resolved to
      stand by them. I may add, that in this purpose to save the country and its
      liberties, no classes of people seem so nearly unanimous as the soldiers
      in the field and the sailors afloat. Do they not have the hardest of it?
      Who should quail while they do not? God bless the soldiers and seamen,
      with all their brave commanders.

      PROCLAMATION OF THANKSGIVING, OCTOBER 20, 1864.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has pleased Almighty God to prolong our national life another year,
      defending us with his guardian care against unfriendly designs from
      abroad, and vouchsafing to us in His mercy many and signal victories over
      the enemy, who is of our own household. It has also pleased our Heavenly
      Father to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in
      their camps, and our sailors on the rivers and seas, with unusual health.
      He has largely augmented our free population by emancipation and by
      immigration, while he has opened to us new: sources of wealth, and has
      crowned the labor of our working-men in every department of industry with
      abundant rewards. Moreover, he has been pleased to animate and inspire our
      minds and hearts with fortitude, courage, and resolution sufficient for
      the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our
      adherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity, and to afford
      to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our
      dangers and afflictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do
      hereby appoint and set apart the last Thursday in November next as a day
      which I desire to be observed by all my fellow-citizens, wherever they may
      be then, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God, the
      beneficent Creator and Ruler of the Universe. And I do further recommend
      to my fellow-citizens aforesaid, that on that occasion they do reverently
      humble themselves in the dust, and from thence offer up penitent and
      fervent prayers and supplications to the great Disposer of events for a
      return of the inestimable blessings of peace, union, and harmony
      throughout the, land which it has pleased him to assign as a
      dwelling-place for ourselves and for our posterity throughout all
      generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of
      the United States to be affixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Done at the city of Washington, this twentieth day of October, in the year
      of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the
      independence of the United States the eighty-ninth.

      TO WILLIAM B. CAMPBELL AND OTHERS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 22, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      MESSRS WILLIAM B. CAMPBELL, THOMAS A. R. NELSON, JAMES T. P. CARTER, JOHN
      WILLIAMS, A. BLIZZARD, HENRY COOPER, BAILLIE PEYTON, JOHN LELLYET, EMERSON
      ETHERIDGE, and JOHN D. PERRYMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      GENTLEMEN:&mdash;On the 15th day of this month, as I remember, a printed
      paper manuscript, with a few manuscript interlineations, called a protest,
      with your names appended thereto, and accompanied by another printed
      paper, purporting to be a proclamation by Andrew Johnson, Military
      Governor of Tennessee, and also a manuscript paper, purporting to be
      extracts from the Code of Tennessee, were laid before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The protest, proclamation, and extracts are respectively as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      [The protest is here recited, and also the proclamation of Governor
      Johnson, dated September 30, to which it refers, together with a list of
      the counties in East, Middle, and West Tennessee; also extracts from the
      Code of Tennessee in relation to electors of President and Vice-President,
      qualifications of voters for members of the General Assembly, places of
      holding elections, and officers of popular elections.]
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time these papers were presented, as before stated, I had never
      seen either of them, nor heard of the subject to which they related,
      except in a general way one day previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the present moment, nothing whatever upon the subject has passed
      between Governor Johnson, or any one else, connected with the
      proclamation, and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since receiving the papers, as stated, I have given the subject such brief
      consideration as I have been able to do, in the midst of so many pressing
      public duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      My conclusion is, that I can have nothing to do with the matter, either to
      sustain the plan as the convention and Governor Johnson have initiated it,
      or to revoke or modify it as you demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the Constitution and laws, the President is charged with no duty in the
      presidential election in any State, nor do I in this case perceive any
      military reason for his interference in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement set on foot by the convention and Governor Johnson does not,
      as seems to be assumed by you, emanate from the National Executive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no proper sense can it be considered other than an independent movement
      of, at least, a portion of the loyal people of Tennessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not perceive in the plan any menace, or violence, or coercion towards
      any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Governor Johnson, like any other loyal citizen of Tennessee, has the right
      to favor any political plan he chooses, and, as military governor, it is
      his duty to keep peace among and for the loyal people of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot discern that by this plan he purposes any more. But you object to
      the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving it alone will be your perfect security against it. It is not
      proposed to force you into it. Do as you please, on your own account,
      peaceably and loyally, and Governor Johnson will not molest you, but will
      protect you against violence as far as in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      I presume that the conducting of a presidential election in Tennessee in
      strict accordance with the old Code of the State, is not now a
      possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to add, that if any election shall be held and
      any votes shall be cast in the State of Tennessee for President and
      Vice-President of the United States, it will belong, not to the military
      agents, nor yet to the Executive Department, but exclusively to another
      department of the Government, to determine whether they are entitled to be
      counted in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except it be to give protection against violence, I decline to interfere
      in any way with any presidential election.

      RESPONSE TO A SERENADE, NOVEMBER 9, 1864.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:&mdash;Even before I had been informed by you
      that this compliment was paid me by loyal citizens of Pennsylvania,
      friendly to me, I had inferred that you were of that portion of my
      countrymen who think that the best interests of the nation are to be
      subserved by the support of the present administration. I do not pretend
      to say that you, who think so, embrace all the patriotism and loyalty of
      the country, but I do believe, and I trust without personal interest, that
      the welfare of the country does require that such support and indorsement
      should be given.
    </p>
    <p>
      I earnestly believe that the consequences of this day's work, if it be as
      you assume, and as now seems probable, will be to the lasting advantage,
      if not to the very salvation, of the country. I cannot at this hour say
      what has been the result of the election. But, whatever it may be, I have
      no desire to modify this opinion: that all who have labored to-day in
      behalf of the Union have wrought for the best interests of the country and
      the world; not only for the present, but for all future ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am thankful to God for this approval of the people; but, while deeply
      grateful for this mark of their confidence in me, if I know my heart, my
      gratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph. I do not impugn the
      motives of any one opposed to me. It is no pleasure to me to triumph over
      any one, but I give thanks to the Almighty for this evidence of the
      people's resolution to stand by free government and the rights of
      humanity.

    <h2>
      ON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      RESPONSE TO A SERENADE, NOVEMBER 10, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It has long been a grave question whether any government, not too strong
      for the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its
      existence in great emergencies. On this point the present rebellion
      brought our government to a severe test, and a presidential election
      occurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little to
      the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the
      rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a
      political war among themselves? But the election was a necessity. We
      cannot have free government without elections; and if the election could
      force us to forego or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim
      to have already conquered and ruined us. The strife of the election is but
      human nature practically applied to the facts of the case. What has
      occurred in this case must ever recur in similar cases. Human nature will
      not change. In any future great national trial, compared with the men of
      this, we will have as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and
      as good. Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this as philosophy to
      learn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the election, along with its incidental and undesirable strife, has
      done good, too. It has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain
      a national election in the midst of a great civil war. Until now, it has
      not been known to the world that this was a possibility. It shows, also,
      how sound and strong we still are. It shows that even among the candidates
      of the same party, he who is most devoted to the Union and most opposed to
      treason can receive most of the people's votes. It shows, also, to the
      extent yet known, that we have more men now than we had when the war
      began. Gold is good in its place; but living, brave, and patriotic men are
      better than gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is over, may not
      all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our
      common country? For my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid
      placing any obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I have not
      willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom. While I am duly sensible to
      the high compliment of a re-election, and duly grateful, as I trust, to
      Almighty God, for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion, as
      I think, for their good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other
      man may be disappointed by the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      May I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same
      spirit towards those who have? And now, let me close by asking three
      hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen, and their gallant and
      skillful commanders.

      TO GENERAL S. A. HURLBUT.

    <h3>
      (Private.)
    </h3>
    <p>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, November 14, 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAJOR-GENERAL HURLBUT:
    </p>
    <p>
      Few things since I have been here have impressed me more painfully than
      what, for four or five months past, has appeared a bitter military
      opposition to the new State government of Louisiana. I still indulged some
      hope that I was mistaken in the fact; but copies of a correspondence on
      the subject between General Canby and yourself, and shown me to-day,
      dispel that hope. A very fair proportion of the people of Louisiana have
      inaugurated a new State government, making an excellent new constitution&mdash;better
      for the poor black man than we have in Illinois. This was done under
      military protection, directed by me, in the belief, still sincerely
      entertained, that with such a nucleus around which to build we could get
      the State into position again sooner than otherwise. In this belief a
      general promise of protection and support, applicable alike to Louisiana
      and other States, was given in the last annual message. During the
      formation of the new government and constitution they were supported by
      nearly every loyal person, and opposed by every secessionist. And this
      support and this opposition, from the respective standpoints of the
      parties, was perfectly consistent and logical. Every Unionist ought to
      wish the new government to succeed; and every disunionist must desire it
      to fail. Its failure would gladden the heart of Slidell in Europe, and of
      every enemy of the old flag in the world. Every advocate of slavery
      naturally desires to see blasted and crushed the liberty promised the
      black man by the new constitution. But why General Canby and General
      Hurlbut should join on the same side is to me incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, in the condition of things at New Orleans, the military must
      not be thwarted by the civil authority; but when the Constitutional
      Convention, for what it deems a breach of privilege, arrests an editor in
      no way connected with the military, the military necessity for insulting
      the convention and forcibly discharging the editor is difficult to
      perceive. Neither is the military necessity for protecting the people
      against paying large salaries fixed by a legislature of their own choosing
      very apparent. Equally difficult to perceive is the military necessity for
      forcibly interposing to prevent a bank from loaning its own money to the
      State. These things, if they have occurred, are, at the best, no better
      than gratuitous hostility. I wish I could hope that they may be shown not
      to have occurred. To make assurance against misunderstanding, I repeat
      that in the existing condition of things in Louisiana, the military must
      not be thwarted by the civil authority; and I add that on points of
      difference the commanding general must be judge and master. But I also add
      that in the exercise of this judgment and control, a purpose, obvious, and
      scarcely unavowed, to transcend all military necessity, in order to crush
      out the civil government, will not be overlooked.

      REPLY TO MARYLAND UNION COMMITTEE, NOVEMBER 17, 1864.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The President, in reply, said that he had to confess he had been duly
      notified of the intention to make this friendly call some days ago, and in
      this he had had a fair opportunity afforded to be ready with a set speech;
      but he had not prepared one, being too busy for that purpose. He would
      say, however, that he was gratified with the result of the presidential
      election. He had kept as near as he could to the exercise of his best
      judgment for the interest of the whole country, and to have the seal of
      approbation stamped on the course he had pursued was exceedingly grateful
      to his feelings. He thought he could say, in as large a sense as any other
      man, that his pleasure consisted in belief that the policy he had pursued
      was the best, if not the only one, for the safety of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had said before, and now repeated, that he indulged in no feeling of
      triumph over any man who thought or acted differently from himself. He had
      no such feeling toward any living man. When he thought of Maryland, in
      particular, he was of the opinion that she had more than double her share
      in what had occurred in the recent elections. The adoption of a free-State
      constitution was a greater thing than the part taken by the people of the
      State in the presidential election. He would any day have stipulated to
      lose Maryland in the presidential election to save it by the adoption of a
      free-State constitution, because the presidential election comes every
      four years, while that is a thing which, being done, cannot be undone. He
      therefore thought that in that they had a victory for the right worth a
      great deal more than their part in the presidential election, though of
      the latter he thought highly. He had once before said, but would say
      again, that those who have differed with us and opposed us will see that
      the result of the presidential election is better for their own good than
      if they had been successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanking the committee for their compliment, he brought his brief speech
      to a close.

    <p>
      Whereas by my proclamation of the 19th of April, 1861, it was declared
      that the ports of certain States, including those of Norfolk, in the State
      of Virginia, Fernandina and Pensacola, in the State of Florida, were, for
      reasons therein set forth, intended to be placed under blockade; and:
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas the said ports were subsequently blockaded accordingly, but having
      for some time past been in the military possession of the United States,
      it is deeemd advisable that they should be opened to domestic and foreign
      commerce:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the

      act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for
      other purposes," do hereby declare that the blockade of the said ports of
      Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola shall so far cease and determine, from
      and after the first day of December next, that commercial intercourse with
      those ports, except as to persons, things, and information contraband of
      war, may, from that time, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United
      States, to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations which may
      be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and to such military and
      naval regulations as are now in force, or may hereafter be found
      necessary.

    <p>
      On Thursday of last week, two ladies from Tennessee came before the
      President, asking the release of their husbands held as prisoners of war
      at Johnson's Island. They were put off until Friday, when they came again,
      and were again put off until Saturday. At each of the interviews one of
      the ladies urged that her husband was a religious man, and on Saturday the
      President ordered the release of the prisoners, when he said to this lady:
      "You say your husband is a religious man; tell him when you meet him, that
      I say I am not much of a judge of religion, but that, in my opinion, the
      religion that sets men to rebel and fight against their own government,
      because, as they think, that government does not sufficiently help some
      men to eat their bread in the sweat of other men's faces, is not the sort
      of religion upon which people can get to heaven."

      ORDER CONCERNING THE STEAMER "FUNAYMA SOLACE."
    </h2>
    <h3>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 3, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A war steamer, called the Funayma Solace, having been built in this
      country, for the Japanese government and at the instance of that
      government, it is deemed to comport with the public interest, in view of
      the unsettled condition of the relations of the United States with that
      Empire, that the steamer should not be allowed to proceed to Japan. If,
      however, the Secretary of the Navy should ascertain that the steamer is
      adapted to our service, he is authorized to purchase her, but the purchase
      money will be held in trust toward satisfying any valid claims which may
      be presented by the Japanese on account of the construction of the steamer
      and the failure to deliver the same, as above set forth.

      WASHINGTON CITY, December 5, 1864
    </p>
    <p>
      TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
    </p>
    <p>
      In conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that
      Captain John A. Winslow, United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks from
      Congress for the skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the brilliant
      action whilst in command of the United States steamer Keaysarge, which led
      to the total destruction of the piratical craft Alabama, on the 19th of
      June, 1864., a vessel superior in tonnage, superior in number of guns, and
      superior in number of crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the
      requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the
      following words, viz:
    </p>
    <p>
      That any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one
      grade, if, upon recommendation by the President by name he receives the
      thanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the
      enemy, or far extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession.

      MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WASHINGTON CITY, December 5, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
    </p>
    <p>
      In conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that
      Lieutenant William B. Gushing, United States Navy, receive a vote of
      thanks from Congress for his important, gallant, and perilous achievement
      in destroying the rebel ironclad steamer Albemarle on the night of the
      27th of October, 1864., at Plymouth, N. C.
    </p>
    <p>
      The destruction of so formidable a vessel, which had resisted the
      continued attacks of a number of our vessels on former occasions, is an
      important event touching our future naval and military operations, and
      would reflect honor on any officer, and redounds to the credit of this
      young officer and the few brave comrades who assisted in this successful
      and daring undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the
      requirements of the ninth section of the Aforesaid act, which is in the
      following words, namely:
    </p>
    <p>
      That any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one

    <h2>
      ANNUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DECEMBER 6, 1864.
    </h3>
    <p>
      FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest
      gratitude to Almighty God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mexico continues to be a theater of civil war. While our political
      relations with that country have undergone no change, we have at the same
      time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a competent
      engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan and
      the port of San Juan. It is a source of much satisfaction that the
      difficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions and
      caused a closing of the interoceanic transit route have been amicably
      adjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be
      reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation. We could not
      exaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that great
      improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be doing injustice to an important South American State not to
      acknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with which the
      United States of Colombia have entered into intimate relations with this
      government. A claims convention has been constituted to complete the
      unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect with the
      universal acquiescence of the people, the government under it has been
      recognized and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial and
      friendly spirit. The long-deferred Aves Island claim has been
      satisfactorily paid and discharged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint
      commission for the settlement of claims between the United States and
      Peru. An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the two
      countries, and such efforts as were in my power have been used to remove
      misunderstanding, and avert a threatened war between Peru and Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile, the Argentine
      Republic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Salvador, and Haiti.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of
      these republics, and on the other hand, their sympathies with the United
      States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonian in
      1821 has been paid in full by the Government of Chile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Civil war continues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently without
      prospect of an early close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Official correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it gives
      us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that republic. It
      may be expected to derive new vigor from American influence improved by
      the rapid disappearance of slavery in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      I solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat, at moderate
      cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by instalments. Such a vessel
      is needed for the safety of that state against the native African races,
      and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African
      slave-trade than a squadron in our own hands. The possession of the least
      organized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the republic,
      and the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win
      forbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by the way of
      Bering Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress at the
      last session, has been undertaken, under very favorable circumstances, by
      an association of American citizens, with the cordial good-will and
      support as well of this Government as of those of Great Britain and
      Russia. Assurances have been received from most of the South American
      States of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their readiness to
      co-operate in constructing lines tributary to that world-encircling
      communication. I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a
      telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of America and Great
      Britain has been renewed, with full expectation of its early
      accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will
      be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of
      commerce and civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April last.
      An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of
      the office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in a suspension of
      intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the
      successor in the consulate, and our relations with Egypt, as well as our
      relations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last been
      suppressed, with the co-operating good offices of this Government and of
      the other Western commercial States. The judicial consular establishment
      there has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need legislative
      revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to the more
      intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the Government and
      people of that vast Empire. China seems to be accepting with hearty
      good-will the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social
      intercourse among the Western nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its
      Government, the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is
      inconstant and capricious. Nevertheless, good progress has been effected
      by the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary
      claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement, and the inland
      sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that
      these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of
      Japan toward the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by
      proclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether
      it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as just to the
      United States, to resort to these and other open ports than it is to
      pursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a contraband trade with
      other ports which are closed, if not by actual military occupation, at
      least by a lawful and effective blockade.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive, under
      the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in
      the United States. If Congress should think that proceedings in such cases
      lack the authority of law, or ought to be further regulated by it, I
      recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave
      traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal
      occupation in our country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible that if it were a new and open question the maritime
      powers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede the privileges
      of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States, destitute,
      as they are, and always have been, equally of ships of war and of ports
      and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither assiduous nor more
      successful during the last year than they were before that time in their
      efforts, under favor of that privilege, to embroil our country in foreign
      wars. The desire and determination of the governments of the maritime
      states to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and can not
      be more earnest than our own. Nevertheless, unforeseen political
      difficulties have arisen, especially in Brazilian and British ports and on
      the northern boundary of the United States, which have required, and are
      likely to continue to require, the practice of constant vigilance and a
      just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States, as well as
      of the nations concerned and their governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain on
      the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson Bay and Puget Sound
      Agricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution
      of the trust assigned to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to
      the Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredations
      committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it has
      been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six
      months, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement
      with Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty to
      increase their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find that
      proceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily come
      into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or
      modifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States, as
      well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily established by
      the reciprocity treaty of the 5th June, 1854.
    </p>
    <p>
      I desire, however, to be understood while making this statement that the
      colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust
      or unfriendly toward the United States, but, on the contrary, there is
      every reason to expect that, with the approval of the Imperial Government,
      they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the
      border.
    </p>
    <p>
      The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration
      has so far as was possible been put into operation. It seems to need
      amendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent the
      practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their
      arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of
      avocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition toward this
      great national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and
      ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective
      national protection. I regard our immigrants as one of the principal
      replenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the
      ravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health.
      All that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present
      fullness, and to that end the Government must in every way make it
      manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military
      service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our
      country. The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully
      administered during the last year. The legislation of the last session of
      Congress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficient time
      has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the
      provisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis of warrants
      signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and the balance
      in the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were $1,394,196,007.62, and
      the aggregate disbursements, upon the same basis, were $1,298,056,101.89,
      leaving a balance in the Treasury, as shown by warrants, of
      $96,739,905.73.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt
      redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and the actual
      cash operations of the Treasury were: receipts, $884,076,646.57;
      disbursements, $865,234,087.86; which leaves a cash balance in the
      Treasury of $18,842,558.71.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152.99, from
      lands $588,333.29, from direct taxes $475,648.96, from internal revenue
      $109,741,134.10, from miscellaneous sources $47,511,448.10, and from loans
      applied to actual expenditures, including former balance, $623,443,929.13.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were disbursed for the civil service $27,505,599.46, for pensions
      and Indians $7,517,930.97, for the War Department $690,791,842.97, for the
      Navy Department $85,733,292.77, for interest on the public debt
      $53,685,421.69, making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86, and leaving a
      balance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the
      estimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of
      the current fiscal year, and the general operations of the Treasury in
      detail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. I
      concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to
      meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should be
      still further increased; and I earnestly invite your attention to this
      subject to the end that there be such additional legislation as shall be
      required to meet the just expectations of the Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public debt on the first day of July last, as appears by the books of
      the Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489.49. Probably, should the war
      continue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from
      $500,000,000. Held, as it is, for the most part by our own people, it has
      become a substantial branch of national, though private, property. For
      obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be distributed among all
      the people the better. To favor such general distribution, greater
      inducements to become owners might, perhaps, with good effect and without
      injury be presented to persons of limited means. With this view I suggest
      whether it might not be both competent and expedient for Congress to
      provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities
      might be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from
      seizure for debt, under such restrictions and limitations as might be
      necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege. This would
      enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a
      possible day of want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to
      the amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who might
      be able to save enough for the purpose. The great advantage of citizens
      being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is
      obvious. Men readily perceive that they can not be much oppressed by a
      debt which they owe to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public debt on the first day of July last, although somewhat exceeding
      the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the
      commencement of the last session, falls short of the estimate of that
      officer made in the preceding December as to its probable amount at the
      beginning of this year by the sum of $3,995,097.31. This fact exhibits a
      satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the Treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists and
      to the people. On the twenty-fifth day of November five hundred and
      eighty-four national banks had been organized, a considerable number of
      which were conversions from State banks. Changes from State systems to the
      national system are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon
      there will be in the United States no banks of issue not authorized by
      Congress and no bank-note circulation not secured by the Government. That
      the Government and the people will derive great benefit from this change
      in the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned. The
      national system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support
      of the national credit and protect the people against losses in the use of
      paper money. Whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the
      suppression of State-bank issues, it will be for Congress to determine. It
      seems quite clear that the Treasury can not be satisfactorily conducted
      unless the Government can exercise a restraining power over the bank-note
      circulation of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will
      detail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last
      annual message, and also the operations of the several administrative
      bureaus of the War Department during the last year. It will also specify
      the measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and
      supply the requisite military force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and
      satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval
      service. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our
      countrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so
      brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under construction on
      the first of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying 4610
      guns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the year, over
      and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83 vessels, 167 guns,
      and 42,427 tons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total number of men at this time in the naval service, including
      officers, is about 51,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels, and the
      whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1379, of
      which 267 are steamers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property thus
      far reported amount to $14,369,250.51. A large amount of such proceeds is
      still under adjudication and yet to be reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description,
      including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into
      existence from the fourth of March, 1861, to the first of November, 1864,
      is $238,647,262.35.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations of
      the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy-yard and
      suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and
      the machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference was made in
      my last annual message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in
      relation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect to
      prize on our inland waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the
      propriety of creating the new rank of vice-admiral in our naval service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster-General for a
      detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the
      Post-Office Department.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to
      $12,438,253.78, and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20, the excess of
      expenditures over receipts being $206,532.42.
    </p>
    <p>
      The views presented by the Postmaster-General on the subject of special
      grants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean
      mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of
      increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries
      should receive the careful consideration of Congress.
    </p>

      It is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population,
      improvement, and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied
      portions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impeded or
      destroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem to
      have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been completed
      in conformity with law, and thus our excellent system is firmly
      established in the mountains, which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable
      waste between the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the
      coast of the Pacific Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity
      and rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance and
      the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities, have
      been only partially organized; but it is understood that these
      difficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their governments,
      like those of the others, to go into speedy and full operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of the
      nation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable information and
      important recommendations relating to the public lands, Indian affairs,
      the Pacific Railroad, and mineral discoveries contained in the report of
      the Secretary of the Interior which is herewith transmitted, and which
      report also embraces the subjects of patents, pensions, and other topics
      of public interest pertaining to his Department.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending on
      the thirtieth of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614
      acres were entered under the homestead law. The remainder was located with
      military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for
      railroads, and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location
      fees was $1,019,446.
    </p>
    <p>
      The income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was
      $678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the preceding year. The
      aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the
      quantity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about 133,000,000
      acres of surveyed land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States by
      railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives
      assurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the
      prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of the main line
      of the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward
      from the initial point at Omaha City, Nebraska, and a preliminary location
      of the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from Sacramento
      eastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines have been added
      to the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra
      Nevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with
      enterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is believed that the
      produce of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year
      reached, if not exceeded, $100,000,000 in value.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be
      remodeled. Congress at its last session, acting upon the recommendation,
      did provide for reorganizing the system in California, and it is believed
      that under the present organization the management of the Indians there
      will be attended with reasonable success. Much yet remains to be done to
      provide for the proper government of the Indians in other parts of the
      country, to render it secure for the advancing settler, and to provide for
      the welfare of the Indian. The Secretary reiterates his recommendations,
      and to them the attention of Congress is invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid
      soldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows, orphans, and
      dependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease
      contracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have been
      diligently administered. There have been added to the pension rolls during
      the year ending the 30th day of June last the names of 16,770 invalid
      soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army
      invalid pensioners 22,767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of widows, orphans, and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the army
      pension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of army
      pensioners of this class is 25,433 and of navy pensioners 793. At the
      beginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1430.
      Only twelve of them were soldiers, of whom seven have since died. The
      remainder are those who under the law receive pensions because of
      relationship to Revolutionary soldiers. During the year ending the
      thirtieth of June, 1864, $4,504,616.92 have been paid to pensioners of all
      classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent
      institutions of the District of Columbia which have hitherto been
      established or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer for
      information concerning them and in relation to the Washington Aqueduct,
      the Capitol, and other matters of local interest to the report of the
      Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Agricultural Department, under the supervision of its present
      energetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending itself to the great and
      vital interest it was created to advance. It is peculiarly the people's
      department, in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other.
      I commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war continues. Since the last annual message all the important lines
      and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained and our
      arms have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left in rear, so
      that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States have again
      produced reasonably fair crops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is
      General Sherman's attempted march of three hundred miles directly through
      the insurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relative
      strength that our General-in-Chief should feel able to confront and hold
      in check every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach a
      well-appointed large army to move on such an expedition. The result not
      yet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of
      molding society for durability in the Union. Although short of complete
      success, it is much in the right direction that twelve thousand citizens
      in each of the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State
      governments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to
      maintain and administer them. The movements in the same direction more
      extensive though less definite in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
      should not be overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of complete
      success. Maryland is secure to liberty and union for all the future. The
      genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul spirit
      being driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of the Constitution
      abolishing slavery throughout the United States passed the Senate, but
      failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the House of
      Representatives. Although the present is the same Congress and nearly the
      same members, and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those
      who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the reconsideration and
      passage of the measure at the present session. Of course the abstract
      question is not changed; but an intervening election shows almost
      certainly that the next Congress will pass the measure if this does not.
      Hence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment
      will go to the States for their action. And as it is to so go at all
      events, may we not agree that the sooner the better? It is not claimed
      that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or
      their votes any further than, as an additional element to be considered,
      their judgment may be affected by it. It is the voice of the people now
      for the first time heard upon the question. In a great national crisis
      like ours, unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very
      desirable, almost indispensable. And yet no approach to such unanimity is
      attainable unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority
      simply because it is the will of the majority. In this case the common end
      is the maintenance of the Union, and among the means to secure that end
      such will, through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of such
      Constitutional amendment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is derived
      through our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass and its
      result, the purpose of the people within the loyal States to maintain the
      integrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than
      now. The extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of
      voters met and mingled at the polls give strong assurance of this. Not
      only all those who supported the Union ticket, so called, but a great
      majority of the opposing party also may be fairly claimed to entertain and
      to be actuated by the same purpose. It is an unanswerable argument to this
      effect that no candidate for any office whatever, high or low, has
      ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the Union.
      There have been much impugning of motives and much heated controversy as
      to the proper means and best mode of advancing the Union cause, but on the
      distinct issue of Union or no Union the politicians have shown their
      instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people. In
      affording the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to
      the world this firmness and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of
      vast value to the national cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be known&mdash;the
      fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of
      national resources, that of living men. While it is melancholy to reflect
      that the war has filled so many graves and carried mourning to so many
      hearts, it is some relief to know that, compared with the surviving, the
      fallen have been so few. While corps and divisions and brigades and
      regiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gone out of existence, a
      great majority of the men who composed them are still living. The same is
      true of the naval service. The election returns prove this. So many voters
      could not else be found. The States regularly holding elections, both now
      and four years ago, to wit, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,
      Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
      Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon,
      Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast
      3,982,011 votes now, against 3,870,222 cast then, showing an aggregate now
      of 3,982,011. To this is to be added 33,762 cast now in the new States of
      Kansas and Nevada, which States did not vote in 1860, thus swelling the
      aggregate to 4,015,773 and the net increase during the three years and a
      half of war to 145,551. A table is appended showing particulars. To this
      again should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from
      Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, and
      California, who by the laws of those States could not vote away from their
      homes, and which number can not be less than 90,000. Nor yet is this all.
      The number in organized Territories is triple now what it was four years
      ago&mdash;while thousands, white and black, join us as the national arms
      press back the insurgent lines. So much is shown, affirmatively and
      negatively, by the election. It is not material to inquire how the
      increase has been produced or to show that it would have been greater but
      for the war, which is probably true. The important fact remains
      demonstrated that we have more men now than we had when the war began;
      that we are not exhausted nor in process of exhaustion; that we are
      gaining strength and may if need be maintain the contest indefinitely.
      [This sentence recognizes the concern of a guerilla war after the main war
      finished.]This as to men. Material resources are now more complete and
      abundant than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The national resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe,
      inexhaustible. The public purpose to re-establish and maintain the
      national authority is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable. The
      manner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On careful
      consideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no
      attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good.
      He would accept nothing short of severance of the Union, precisely what we
      will not and can not give. His declarations to this effect are explicit
      and oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords us no
      excuse to deceive ourselves. He can not voluntarily reaccept the Union; we
      can not voluntarily yield it. Between him and us the issue is distinct,
      simple, and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war and
      decided by victory. If we yield, we are beaten; if the Southern people
      fail him, he is beaten. Either way it would be the victory and defeat
      following war. What is true, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause
      is not necessarily true of those who follow. Although he can not reaccept
      the Union, they can. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and
      reunion. The number of such may increase. They can at any moment have
      peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national
      authority under the Constitution. After so much the Government could not,
      if it would, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain
      or allow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the
      peaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating
      only in Constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain, and other
      possible, questions are and would be beyond the Executive power to adjust;
      as, for instance, the admission of members into Congress and whatever
      might require the appropriation of money. The Executive power itself would
      be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons and
      remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within Executive
      control. In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be
      fairly judged of by the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were offered
      to all except certain designated classes, and it was at the same time made
      known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special
      clemency. During the year many availed themselves of the general
      provision, and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some
      led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less
      easy and certain. During the same time also special pardons have been
      granted to individuals of the excepted classes, and no voluntary
      application has been denied. Thus practically the door has been for a full
      year open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice;
      that is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still so open
      to all. But the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall
      demand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than
      heretofore shall be adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national
      authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable
      condition to ending the war on the part of the Government, I retract
      nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made a
      year ago, that "while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt
      to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to
      slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any
      of the acts of Congress." If the people should, by whatever mode or means,
      make it an Executive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, and not I,
      must be their instrument to perform it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In stating a single condition of peace I mean simply to say that the war
      will cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased on
      the part of those who began it.

      ORIGIN OF THE "GREENBACK" CURRENCY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TO COLONEL B. D. TAYLOR
    </h3>
    <p>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December [16?], 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR COLONEL DICK:&mdash;I have long determined to make public the origin
      of the greenback and tell the world that it is Dick Taylor's creation. You
      had always been friendly to me, and when troublous times fell on us, and
      my shoulders, though broad and willing, were weak, and myself surrounded
      by such circumstances and such people that I knew not whom to trust, then
      I said in my extremity: "I will send for Colonel Taylor; he will know what
      to do." I think it was in January, 1862, on or about the 16th, that I did
      so. You came, and I said to you:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can we do?" Said you, "Why, issue Treasury notes bearing no
      interest, printed on the best banking paper. Issue enough to pay off the
      Army expenses and declare it legal tender."
    </p>
    <p>
      Chase thought it a hazardous thing, but we finally accomplished it, and
      gave the people of this Republic the greatest blessing they ever had&mdash;their
      own paper to pay their own debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is due to you, the father of the present greenback, that the people
      should know it, and I take great pleasure in making it known. How many
      times have I laughed at you telling me plainly that I was too lazy to be
      anything but a lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly,

      CALL FOR 300,000 VOLUNTEERS, DECEMBER 19, 1864.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A Proclamation
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, by the act approved July 4, 1864, entitled "An act further to
      regulate and provide for the enrolling and calling out the national
      forces, and for other purposes," it is provided that the President of the
      United States may, "at his discretion, at any time hereafter, call for any
      number of men, as volunteers for the respective terms of one, two, and
      three years for military service," and "that in case the quota or any part
      thereof of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct, or election
      district, or of any country not so subdivided, shall not be filled within
      the space of fifty days after such call, then the President shall
      immediately order a draft for one year to fill such quota or any part
      thereof which may be unfilled;" and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, by the credits allowed in accordance with the act of Congress on
      the call for 500,000 men, made July 18, 1864, the number of men to be
      obtained under that call was reduced to 280,000; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, the operations of the enemy in certain States have rendered it
      impracticable to procure from them their full quotas of troops under said
      call; and
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas, from the foregoing causes but 240,000 men have been put into the
      Army, Navy, and Marine Corps under the said call of July 18, 1864, leaving
      a deficiency on that call of two hundred and sixty thousand (260,000):
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of
      America, in order to supply the aforesaid deficiency and to provide for
      casualties in the military and naval service of the United States, do
      issue this my call for three hundred thousand (300,000) volunteers to
      serve for one, two, or three years. The quotas of the States, districts,
      and subdistricts under this call will be assigned by the War Department
      through the bureau of the Provost-Marshal General of the United States,
      and "in case the quota or any part thereof of any town, township, ward of
      a city, precinct, or election district, or of any county not so
      subdivided, shall not be filled" before the fifteenth of February, 1865,
      then a draft shall be made to fill such quota or any part thereof under
      this call which may be unfilled on said fifteenth day of February, 1865.

      SHERMAN'S MARCH TO THE SEA
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TO GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, December 26, 1864
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR GENERAL SHERMAN:&mdash;Many, many thanks for your Christmas gift,
      the capture of Savannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you were about leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic coast, I was anxious,
      if not fearful; but feeling that you were the better judge, and
      remembering that "nothing risked, nothing gained," I did not interfere.
      Now, the undertaking being a success, the honor is all yours; for I
      believe none of us went further than to acquiesce.
    </p>
    <p>
      And taking the work of General Thomas into the count, as it should be
      taken, it is indeed a great success. Not only does it afford the obvious
      and immediate military advantages; but in showing to the world that your
      army could be divided, putting the stronger part to an important new
      service, and yet leaving enough to vanquish the old opposing force of the
      whole,&mdash;Hood's army,&mdash;it brings those who sat in darkness to see
      a great light. But what next?
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose it will be safe if I leave General Grant and yourself to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please make my grateful acknowledgments to your whole army of officers and
      men.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Dr. JOHN MACLEAN:
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR:&mdash;I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your
      note of the twentieth of December, conveying the announcement that the
      Trustees of the College of New Jersey had conferred upon me the degree of
      Doctor of Laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assurance conveyed by this high compliment, that the course of the
      Government which I represent, has received the approval of a body of
      gentlemen of such character and intelligence, in this time of public
      trial, is most grateful to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughtful men must feel that the fate of civilization upon this continent
      is involved in the issue of our contest. Among the most gratifying proofs
      of this conviction is the hearty devotion everywhere exhibited by our
      schools and colleges to the national cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am most thankful if my labors have seemed to conduct to the preservation
      of those institutions, under which alone we can expect good government and
      in its train sound learning, and the progress of the liberal arts.
    </p>

    <p>
      TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:
    </p>
    <p>
      I herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, a "joint
      resolution to correct certain clerical errors in the internal revenue
      act," without my approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      My reason for so doing is that I am informed that this joint resolution
      was prepared during the last moments of the last session of Congress for
      the purpose of correcting certain errors of reference in the internal
      revenue act, which were discovered on an examination of an official copy
      procured from the State Department a few hours only before the
      adjournment. It passed the House and went to the Senate, where a vote was
      taken upon it, but by some accident it was not presented to the President
      of the Senate for his signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the adjournment of the last session of Congress, other errors of a
      kind similar to those which this resolution was designed to correct, have
      been discovered in the law, and it is now thought most expedient to
      include all the necessary corrections in one act or resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attention of the proper committee of the House has, I am informed,
      been already directed to the preparation of a bill for this purpose.

      British North American provinces adjoining the United States, in the
      manner prescribed in the act of Congress of the third of March, 1845,
      which designates certain frontier ports through which merchandise may be
      exported, and further provides "that such other ports situated on the

    <p>
      It is represented to me that there is so much irregular violence in
      northern Missouri as to be driving away the people and almost depopulating
      it. Please gather information, and consider whether an appeal to the
      people there to go to their homes and let one another alone recognizing as
      a full right of protection for each that he lets others alone, and banning
      only him who refuses to let others alone may not enable you to withdraw
      the troops, their presence itself [being] a cause of irritation and
      constant apprehension, and thus restore peace and quiet, and returning
      prosperity. Please consider this and telegraph or write me.

      Please read and answer this letter as though I was not President, but only
      a friend. My son, now in his twenty-second year, having graduated at
      Harvard, wishes to see something of the war before it ends. I do not wish
      to put him in the ranks, nor yet to give him a commission, to which those
      who have already served long are better entitled and better qualified to
      hold. Could he, without embarrassment to you, or detriment to the service,
      go into your military family with some nominal rank, I, and not the
      public, furnishing his necessary means? If no, say so without the least
      hesitation, because I am as anxious and as deeply interested that you

      REPLY TO A COMMITTEE, JANUARY 24, 1865.

    <h3>
      REVEREND SIR, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I accept with emotions of profoundest gratitude, the beautiful gift you
      have been pleased to present to me. You will, of course, expect that I
      acknowledge it. So much has been said about Gettysburg and so well, that
      for me to attempt to say more may perhaps only serve to weaken the force
      of that which has already been said. A most graceful and eloquent tribute
      was paid to the patriotism and self-denying labors of the American ladies,
      on the occasion of the consecration of the National Cemetery at
      Gettysburg, by our illustrious friend, Edward Everett, now, alas! departed
      from earth. His life was a truly great one, and I think the greatest part
      of it was that which crowned its closing years, I wish you to read, if you
      have not already done so, the eloquent and truthful words which he then
      spoke of the women of America. Truly, the services they have rendered to
      the defenders of our country in this perilous time, and are yet rendering,
      can never be estimated as they ought to be. For your kind wishes to me
      personally, I beg leave to render you likewise my sincerest thanks. I
      assure you they are reciprocated. And now, gentlemen and ladies, may God
      bless you all.

      1. The restoration of the national authority throughout all the States.

      CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR THE ABOLISHING OF SLAVERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      PASSAGE THROUGH CONGRESS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR THE
      ABOLISHING OF SLAVERY
    </p>
    <p>
      RESPONSE TO A SERENADE, JANUARY 31, 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
      He supposed the passage through Congress of the Constitutional amendment
      for the abolishing of slavery throughout the United States was the
      occasion to which he was indebted for the honor of this call.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion was one of congratulation to the country, and to the whole
      world. But there is a task yet before us&mdash;to go forward and
      consummate by the votes of the States that which Congress so nobly began
      yesterday. He had the honor to inform those present that Illinois had
      already done the work. Maryland was about half through, but he felt proud
      that Illinois was a little ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought this measure was a very fitting if not an indispensable adjunct
      to the winding up of the great difficulty. He wished the reunion of all
      the States perfected, and so effected as to remove all causes of
      disturbance in the future; and, to attain this end, it was necessary that
      the original disturbing cause should, if possible, be rooted out. He
      thought all would bear him witness that he had never shirked from doing
      all that he could to eradicate slavery, by issuing an Emancipation
      Proclamation. But that proclamation falls short of what the amendment will
      be when fully consummated. A question might be raised whether the
      proclamation was legally valid. It might be added, that it only aided
      those who came into our lines, and that it was inoperative as to those who
      did not give themselves up; or that it would have no effect upon the
      children of the slaves born hereafter; in fact, it would be urged that it
      did not meet the evil. But this amendment is a king's cure for all evils.
      It winds the whole thing up. He would repeat, that it was the fitting if
      not the indispensable adjunct to the consummation of the great game we are
      playing. He could not but congratulate all present&mdash;himself, the
      country, and the whole world upon this great moral victory.

      TO GOVERNOR SMITH.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, February 8, 1865.
    </h3>
    <p>
      HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SMITH, of Vermont:
    </p>
    <p>
      Complaint is made to me, by Vermont, that the assignment of her quota for
      the draft on the pending call is intrinsically unjust, and also in bad
      faith of the Government's promise to fairly allow credits for men
      previously furnished. To illustrate, a supposed case is stated as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Vermont and New Hampshire must between them furnish six thousand men on
      the pending call; and being equal, each must furnish as many as the other
      in the long run. But the Government finds that on former calls Vermont
      furnished a surplus of five hundred, and New Hampshire a surplus, of
      fifteen hundred. These two surpluses making two thousand and added to the
      six thousand, making eight thousand to be furnished by the two States, or
      four thousand each less, by fair credits. Then subtract Vermont's surplus
      of five hundred from her four thousand, leaves three thousand five hundred
      as her quota on the pending call; and likewise subtract New Hampshire's
      surplus of fifteen hundred from her four thousand, leaves two thousand
      five hundred as her quota on the pending call. These three thousand five
      hundred and two thousand five hundred make precisely six thousand, which
      the supposed case requires from the two States, and it is just equal for
      Vermont to furnish one thousand more now than New Hampshire, because New
      Hampshire has heretofore furnished one thousand more than Vermont, which
      equalizes the burdens of the two in the long run. And this result, so far
      from being bad faith to Vermont, is indispensable to keeping good faith
      with New Hampshire. By no other result can the six thousand men be
      obtained from the two States, and, at the same time deal justly and keep
      faith with both, and we do but confuse ourselves in questioning the
      process by which the right result is reached. The supposed case is perfect
      as an illustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pending call is not for three hundred thousand men subject to fair
      credits, but is for three hundred thousand remaining after all fair
      credits have been deducted, and it is impossible to concede what Vermont
      asks without coming out short of three hundred thousand men, or making
      other localities pay for the partiality shown her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This upon the case stated. If there be different reasons for making an
      allowance to Vermont, let them be presented and considered.
    </p>
    <p>

      The joint resolution entitled "Joint resolution declaring certain States
      not entitled to representation in the electoral college" has been signed
      by the Executive in deference to the view of Congress implied in its
      passage and presentation to him. In his own view, however, the two Houses
      of Congress, convened under the twelfth article of the Constitution, have
      complete power to exclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by them
      to be illegal, and it is not competent for the Executive to defeat or
      obstruct that power by a veto, as would be the case if his action were at
      all essential in the matter. He disclaims all right of the Executive to
      interfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral
      votes, and he also disclaims that by signing said resolution he has
      expressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble or any judgment of
      his own upon the subject of the resolution.

    </h3>
    <p>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, February 10, 1865
    </p>
    <p>
      TO THE HONORABLE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to your resolution of the eighth instant, requesting
      information in relation to a conference recently held in Hampton Roads, I
      have the honor to state that on the day of the date I gave Francis P.
      Blair, Sr., a card, written on as follows, to wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      December 28, 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allow the bearer, F. P. Blair, Sr., to pass our lines, go South, and
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. LINCOLN.
    </p>
    <p>
      That at the time I was informed that Mr. Blair sought the card as a means
      of getting to Richmond, Va., but he was given no authority to speak or act
      for the Government, nor was I informed of anything he would say or do on
      his own account or otherwise. Afterwards Mr. Blair told me that he had
      been to Richmond and had seen Mr. Jefferson Davis; and he (Mr. B.) at the
      same time left with me a manuscript letter, as follows, to wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      RICHMOND, VA., January 12, 1865. F. P. BLAIR, ESQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR: I have deemed it proper, and probably desirable to you, to give you
      in this for in the substance of remarks made by me, to be repeated by you
      to President Lincoln, etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no disposition to find obstacles in forms, and am willing, now as
      heretofore, to enter into negotiations for the restoration of peace, and
      am ready to send a commission whenever I have reason to suppose it will be
      received, or to receive a commission if the United States Government shall
      choose to send one. That notwithstanding the rejection of our former
      offers, I would, if you could promise that a commissioner, minister, or
      other agent would be received, appoint one immediately, and renew the
      effort to enter into conference with a view to secure peace to the two
      countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, etc., JEFFERSON DAVIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, and with the view that it should be shown to Mr. Davis, I
      wrote and delivered to Mr. Blair a letter, as follows, to wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      WASHINGTON, January 18, 1865.
    </p>
    <p>

      instant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall
      continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential
      person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with
      the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country.

      is as follows:

      Mr. Davis the original of which the within is a copy, and left it with
      him; that at the time of delivering it Mr. Davis read it over twice in Mr.
      Blair's presence, at the close of which he (Mr. Blair) remarked that the
      part about "our one common country" related to the part of Mr. Davis'
      letter about "the two countries," to which Mr. Davis replied that he so
      understood it.

    </p>
    <p>
      GENERAL:&mdash;The President desires that you will please procure for the
      bearer, Major Thomas T. Eckert, an interview with Messrs. Stephens,
      Hunter, and Campbell, and if on his return to you he requests it pass them
      through our lines to Fortress Monroe by such route and under such military
      precautions as you may deem prudent, giving them protection and
      comfortable quarters while there, and that you let none of this have any
      effect upon your movements or plans.

    <p>
      By order of the President: EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing the proper point to be then reached, I dispatched the Secretary
      of State with the following instructions, Major Eckert, however, going
      ahead of him:
    </p>
    <p>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, January 31, 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
      HON. WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State:
    </p>
    <p>
      You will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Va., there to meet and informally
      confer with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell on the basis of my
      letter to F. P. Blair, Esq., of January 18, 1865, a copy of which you
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will make known to them that three things are indispensable, to Wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The restoration of the national authority throughout all the States.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. No receding by the Executive of the United States on the slavery
      question from the position assumed thereon in the late annual message to
      Congress and in preceding documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war and the
      disbanding of all forces hostile to the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will inform them that all propositions of theirs not inconsistent with
      the above will be considered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere
      liberality. You will hear all they may choose to say and report it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not assume to definitely consummate anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, etc.,
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      HIS EXCELLENCY A. LINCOLN, President of the United States: I have the
      honor to report the delivery of your communication and my letter at 4.15
      this afternoon, to which I received a reply at 6 P.M., but not
      satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 8 P.M. the following note, addressed to General Grant, was received:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT.

    <p>
      "SIR:&mdash;We desire to go to Washington City to confer informally with
      the President personally in reference to the matters mentioned in his
      letter to Mr. Blair of the 18th January ultimo, without any personal
      compromise on any question in the letter. We have the permission to do so
      from the authorities in Richmond.

    </p>
    <p>
      At 9.30 P.M. I notified them that they could not proceed further unless
      they complied with the terms expressed in my letter. The point of meeting
      designated in the above note would not, in my opinion, be insisted upon.
      Think Fort Monroe would be acceptable. Having complied with my

      ordered.

    <p>
      On reading this despatch of Major Eckert I was about to recall him and the
      Secretary of State, when the following telegram of General Grant to the
      Secretary of War was shown me:
    </p>
    <p>
      OFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH, WAR DEPARTMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following telegram received at Washington 4.35 A.M., February 2, 1865,
      from City Point, Va., February 1, 10.30 P.M., 1865:
    </p>
    <p>
      "HON. EDWIN M. STANTON, "Secretary of War:

    <p>
      "Now that the interview between Major Eckert, under his written
      instructions, and Mr. Stephens and party has ended, I will state
      confidentially, but not officially to become a matter of record, that I am
      convinced upon conversation with Messrs. Stephens and Hunter that their
      intentions are good and their desire sincere to restore peace and union. I
      have not felt myself at liberty to express even views of my own or to
      account for my reticency. This has placed me in an awkward position, which
      I could have avoided by not seeing them in the first instance. I fear now
      their going back without any expression from anyone in authority will have
      a bad influence. At the same time, I recognize the difficulties in the way
      of receiving these informal commissioners at this time, and do not know
      what to recommend. I am sorry, however, that Mr. Lincoln can not have an
      interview with the two named in this despatch, if not all three now within
      our lines. Their letter to me was all that the President's instructions
      contemplated to secure their safe conduct if they had used the same
      language to Major Eckert.

    <p>
      "U.S. GRANT "Lieutenant-General."
    </p>
    <p>
      This despatch of General Grant changed my purpose, and accordingly I
      telegraphed him and the Secretary of State, respectively, as follows:

      On the night of the 2nd I reached Hampton Roads, found the Secretary of
      State and Major Eckert on a steamer anchored offshore, and learned of them
      that the Richmond gentlemen were on another steamer also anchored
      offshore, in the Roads, and that the Secretary of State had not yet seen
      or communicated with them. I ascertained that Major Eckert had literally
      complied with his instructions, and I saw for the first time the answer of
      the Richmond gentlemen to him, which in his despatch to me of the 1st he
      characterizes as "not satisfactory." That answer is as follows, to wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      CITY POINT, VA., February 1, 1865. THOMAS T. ECKERT, Major and
      Aid-de-Camp. MAJOR:-Your note, delivered by yourself this day, has been
      considered. In reply we have to say that we were furnished with a copy of
      the letter of President Lincoln to Francis P. Blair, Esq., of the 18th of
      January ultimo, another copy of which is appended to your note. Our
      instructions are contained in a letter of which the following is a copy:
    </p>
    <p>
      "RICHMOND, January 28, 1865. "In conformity with the letter of Mr.
      Lincoln, of which the foregoing is a copy, you are to proceed to
      Washington City for informal conference with him upon the issues involved
      in the existing war, and for the purpose of securing peace to the two
      countries. "With great respect, your obedient servant, "JEFFERSON DAVIS."
    </p>
    <p>
      The substantial object to be obtained by the informal conference is to
      ascertain upon what terms the existing war can be terminated honorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our instructions contemplate a personal interview between President
      Lincoln and ourselves at Washington City, but with this explanation we are
      ready to meet any person or persons that President Lincoln may appoint at
      such place as he may designate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our earnest desire is that a just and honorable peace may be agreed upon,
      and we are prepared to receive or to submit propositions which may
      possibly lead to the attainment of that end.

      already been given in Major Eckert's despatch of the 1st instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also here saw, for the first time, the following note, addressed by the
      Richmond gentlemen to Major Eckert:
    </p>
    <p>
      CITY POINT, VA., February 2, 1865. THOMAS T. ECKERT, Major and
      Aid-de-Camp. MAJOR:&mdash;In reply to your verbal statement that your
      instructions did not allow you to alter the conditions upon which a
      passport could be given to us, we say that we are willing to proceed to
      Fortress Monroe and there to have an informal conference with any person
      or persons that President Lincoln may appoint on the basis of his letter
      to Francis P. Blair of the 18th of January ultimo, or upon any other terms
      or conditions that he may hereafter propose not inconsistent with the
      essential principles of self-government and popular rights, upon which our
      institutions are founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is our earnest wish to ascertain, after a free interchange of ideas and
      information, upon what principles and terms, if any, a just and honorable
      peace can be established without the further effusion of blood, and to
      contribute our utmost efforts to accomplish such a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think it better to add that in accepting your passport we are not to be
      understood as committing ourselves to anything but to carry to this
      informal conference the views and feelings above expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very respectfully, yours, etc.,

    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the third the three gentlemen, Messrs. Stephens, Hunter,
      and Campbell, came aboard of our steamer and had an interview with the
      Secretary of State and myself of several hours' duration. No question of
      preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned; no
      other person was present; no papers were exchanged or produced; and it was
      in advance agreed that the conversation was to be informal and verbal
      merely. On our part the whole substance of the instructions to the
      Secretary of State hereinbefore recited was stated and insisted upon, and
      nothing was said inconsistent therewith; while by the other party it was
      not said that in any event or on any condition they ever would consent to
      reunion, and yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would
      consent. They seemed to desire a postponement of that question and the
      adoption of some other course first, which, as some of them seemed to
      argue, might or might not lead to reunion, but which course we thought
      would amount to an indefinite postponement. The conference ended without
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing, containing, as is believed, all the information sought is
      respectfully submitted.

    <h3>
      (Extract.) No. 1258.
    </h3>
    <p>
      DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, February 7,1865
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 3d, the President, attended by the Secretary,
      received Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell on board the United States
      steam transport River Queen in Hampton Roads. The conference was
      altogether informal. There was no attendance of secretaries, clerks, or
      other witnesses. Nothing was written or read. The conversation, although
      earnest and free, was calm, and courteous, and kind on both sides. The
      Richmond party approached the discussion rather indirectly, and at no time
      did they either make categorical demands, or tender formal stipulations or
      absolute refusals. Nevertheless, during the conference, which lasted four
      hours, the several points at issue between the Government and the
      insurgents were distinctly raised, and discussed fully, intelligently, and
      in an amicable spirit. What the insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor
      was a postponement of the question of separation, upon which the war is
      waged, and a mutual direction of efforts of the Government, as well as
      those of the insurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for a season
      during which passions might be expected to subside, and the armies be
      reduced, and trade and intercourse between the people of both sections
      resumed. It was suggested by them that through such postponement we might
      now have immediate peace, with some not very certain prospect of an
      ultimate satisfactory adjustment of political relations between this
      Government and the States, section, or people now engaged in conflict with
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion, though deliberately considered, was nevertheless regarded
      by the President as one of armistice or truce, and he announced that we
      can agree to no cessation or suspension of hostilities, except on the
      basis of the disbandment of the insurgent forces, and the restoration of
      the national authority throughout all the States in the Union.
      Collaterally, and in subordination to the proposition which was thus
      announced, the antislavery policy of the United States was reviewed in all
      its bearings, and the President announced that he must not be expected to
      depart from the positions he had heretofore assumed in his proclamation of
      emancipation and other documents, as these positions were reiterated in
      his last annual message. It was further declared by the President that the
      complete restoration of the national authority was an indispensable
      condition of any assent on our part to whatever form of peace might be
      proposed. The President assured the other party that, while he must adhere
      to these positions, he would be prepared, so far as power is lodged with
      the Executive, to exercise liberality. His power, however, is limited by
      the Constitution; and when peace should be made, Congress must necessarily
      act in regard to appropriations of money and to the admission of
      representatives from the insurrectionary States. The Richmond party were
      then informed that Congress had, on the 31st ultimo, adopted by a
      constitutional majority a joint resolution submitting to the several
      States the proposition to abolish slavery throughout the Union, and that
      there is every reason to expect that it will be soon accepted by three
      fourths of the States, so as to become a part of the national organic law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference came to an end by mutual acquiescence, without producing an
      agreement of views upon the several matters discussed, or any of them.
      Nevertheless, it is perhaps of some importance that we have been able to
      submit our opinions and views directly to prominent insurgents, and to
      hear them in answer in a courteous and not unfriendly manner.

      assuming to decide that the conditions of bonds are forfeited, and
      therefore are seizing and selling property to pay damages. This, if true,
      is both outrageous and ridiculous. Do not allow it. The courts, and not
      provost-marshals, are to decide such questions unless when military
      necessity makes an exception. Also excuse John Eaton, of Clay County, and
      Wesley Martin, of Platte, from being sent South, and let them go East if
      anywhere.

    <h2>
      SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS, MARCH 4, 1865.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN:&mdash;At this second appearing to take the oath of the
      presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than
      there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to
      be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four
      years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth
      on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the
      attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new
      could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly
      depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust,
      reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the
      future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were
      anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought
      to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this
      place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent
      agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to
      dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties
      deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation
      survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the
      war came.
    </p>
    <p>
      One eighth of the whole population was colored slaves, not distributed
      generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These
      slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this
      interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and
      extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend
      the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more
      than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected
      for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained.
      Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or
      even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier
      triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same
      Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the
      other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's
      assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces,
      but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not
      be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His
      own purposes. "Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs
      be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh." If
      we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in
      the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued
      through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to
      both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the
      offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine
      attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him?
      Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war
      may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the
      wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited
      toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash
      shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand
      years ago, so still it must be said, "The judgments of the Lord are true
      and righteous altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right
      as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we
      are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have
      borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may
      achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all
      nations.

    <p>
      Your two despatches to the Secretary of War, one relating to supplies for
      the enemy going by the Blackwater, and the other to General Singleton and
      Judge Hughes, have been laid before me by him. As to Singleton and Hughes,
      I think they are not in Richmond by any authority, unless it be from you.
      I remember nothing from me which could aid them in getting there, except a
      letter to you, as follows, to wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON CITY, February 7, 1865. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL
      GRANT, City Point, Va.: General Singleton, who bears you this, claims that
      he already has arrangements made, if you consent, to bring a large amount
      of Southern produce through your lines. For its bearing on our finances, I
      would be glad for this to be done, if it can be, without injuriously
      disturbing your military operations, or supplying the enemy. I wish you to
      be judge and master on these points. Please see and hear him fully, and
      decide whether anything, and, if anything, what, can be done in the
      premises. Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. LINCOLN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe I gave Hughes a card putting him with Singleton on the same
      letter. However this may be, I now authorize you to get Singleton and
      Hughes away from Richmond, if you choose, and can. I also authorize you,
      by an order, or in what form you choose, to suspend all operations on the
      Treasury trade permits, in all places southeastward of the Alleghenies. If
      you make such order, notify me of it, giving a copy, so that I can give
      corresponding direction to the Navy.

      Whereas, the twenty-first section of the act of Congress, approved on the
      3d instant, entitled "An Act to amend the several acts heretofore passed
      to provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces and for
      other purposes," requires that in addition to the other lawful penalties
      of the crime of desertion from the military or naval service, all persons
      who have deserted the military or naval service of the United States who
      shall not return to said service or report themselves to a provost-marshal
      within sixty days after the proclamation hereinafter mentioned, shall be
      deemed and taken to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their
      citizenship and their right to become citizens, and such deserters shall
      be forever incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under the
      United States, or of exercising any rights of citizens thereof; and all
      persons who shall hereafter desert the military or naval service, and all
      persons who, being duly enrolled, shall depart the jurisdiction of the
      district in which they are enrolled, or go beyond the limits of the United
      States with intent to avoid any draft into the military or naval service
      duly ordered, shall be liable to the penalties of this section; and the
      President is hereby authorized and required forthwith, on the passage of
      this act, to issue his proclamation setting forth the provisions of this
      section, in which proclamation the President is requested to notify all
      deserters returning within sixty days as aforesaid that they shall be
      pardoned on condition of returning to their regiments and companies, or to
      such other organizations as they may be assigned to, until they shall have
      served for a period of time equal to their original term of enlistment:
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the

      ordering and requiring all deserters to return to their proper posts; and
      I do hereby notify them that all deserters who shall within sixty days
      from the date of this proclamation, viz., on or before the 10th day of
      May, 1865, return to service or report themselves to a provost-marshal,
      shall be pardoned on condition that they return to their regiments or
      companies or to such other organization as they may be assigned to, and
      serve the remainder of their original terms of enlistment, and in addition
      thereto a period equal to the time lost by desertion.

    <p>
      DEAR Mr. WEED:
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one likes a compliment. Thank you for yours on my little
      notification speech and on the recent inaugural address. I expect the
      latter to wear as well as perhaps better than&mdash;anything I have
      produced; but I believe it is not immediately popular. Men are not
      flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose
      between the Almighty and them. To deny it, however, in this case, is to
      deny that there is a God governing the world. It is a truth which I
      thought needed to be told, and, as whatever of humiliation there is in it
      falls most directly on myself, I thought others might afford for me to
      tell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly yours,
    </p>

      ADDRESS TO AN INDIANA REGIMENT,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MARCH 17, 1865.
    </h3>
    <p>
      FELLOW-CITIZENS:&mdash;It will be but a very few words that I shall
      undertake to say. I was born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana, and lived in
      Illinois; and now I am here, where it is my business to care equally for
      the good people of all the States. I am glad to see an Indiana regiment on
      this day able to present the captured flag to the Governor of Indiana. I
      am not disposed, in saying this, to make a distinction between the States,
      for all have done equally well.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are but few views or aspects of this great war upon which I have not
      said or written something whereby my own opinions might be known. But
      there is one&mdash;the recent attempt of our erring brethren, as they are
      sometimes called, to employ the negro to fight for them. I have neither
      written nor made a speech on that subject, because that was their
      business, not mine, and if I had a wish on the subject, I had not the
      power to introduce it, or make it effective. The great question with them
      was whether the negro, being put into the army, will fight for them. I do
      not know, and therefore cannot decide. They ought to know better than me.
      I have in my lifetime heard many arguments why the negroes ought to be
      slaves; but if they fight for those who would keep them in slavery, it
      will be a better argument than any I have yet heard. He who will fight for
      that, ought to be a slave. They have concluded, at last, to take one out
      of four of the slaves and put them in the army, and that one out of the
      four who will fight to keep the others in slavery, ought to be a slave
      himself, unless he is killed in a fight. While I have often said that all
      men ought to be free, yet would I allow those colored persons to be slaves
      who want to be, and next to them those white people who argue in favor of
      making other people slaves. I am in favor of giving an appointment to such
      white men to try it on for these slaves. I will say one thing in regard to
      the negroes being employed to fight for them. I do know he cannot fight
      and stay at home and make bread too. And as one is about as important as
      the other to them, I don't care which they do. I am rather in favor of
      having them try them as soldiers. They lack one vote of doing that, and I
      wish I could send my vote over the river so that I might cast it in favor
      of allowing the negro to fight. But they cannot fight and work both. We
      must now see the bottom of the enemy's resources. They will stand out as
      long as they can, and if the negro will fight for them they must allow him
      to fight. They have drawn upon their last branch of resources, and we can
      now see the bottom. I am glad to see the end so near at hand. I have said
      now more than I intended, and will therefore bid you good-by.

      PROCLAMATION CONCERNING INDIANS,

      A Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereas reliable information has been received that hostile Indians,
      within the limits of the United States, have been furnished with arms and
      munitions of war by persons dwelling in conterminous foreign territory,
      and are thereby enabled to prosecute their savage warfare upon the exposed
      and sparse settlements of the frontier;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
      United States of America, do hereby proclaim and direct that all persons
      detected in that nefarious traffic shall be arrested and tried by
      court-martial at the nearest military post, and if convicted, shall
      receive the punishment due to their deserts.
    </p>

      ORDER ANNULLING THE SENTENCE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AGAINST BENJAMIN G. SMITH AND FRANKLIN W. SMITH,
    </h3>
    <p>
      MARCH 18, 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am unwilling for the sentence to stand, and be executed, to any extent
      in this case. In the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence
      discloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or
      fraudulent intent on the part of men of such well established good
      character. If the evidence went as far to establish a guilty profit of one
      or two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one or two hundred dollars,
      the case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far different aspect.
      That on this contract, involving some twelve hundred thousand dollars, the
      contractors would plan, and attempt to execute a fraud which, at the most,
      could profit them only one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars,
      is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That they did not, in
      such a case, make far greater gains, proves that they did not, with guilty
      or fraudulent intent, make at all. The judgment and sentence are
      disapproved, and declared null, and the defendants are fully discharged.

    <p>
      Arrived here all safe about 9 P.M. yesterday. No war news. General Grant

      so far as he does know.

      I like Mr. Whiting very much, and hence would wish him to remain or resign
      as best suits himself. Hearing this much from me, do as you think best in
      the matter. General Lee has sent the Russell letter back, concluding, as I
      understand from Grant, that their dignity does not admit of their
      receiving the document from us. Robert just now tells me there was a
      little rumpus up the line this morning, ending about where it began.

      I begin to feel that I ought to be at home and yet I dislike to leave
      without seeing nearer to the end of General Grant's present movement. He
      has now been out since yesterday morning and although he has not been
      diverted from his programme no considerable effort has yet been produced
      so far as we know here. Last night at 10.15 P. M. when it was dark as a
      rainy night without a moon could be, a furious cannonade soon joined in by
      a heavy musketry fire opened near Petersburg and lasted about two hours.
      The sound was very distinct here as also were the flashes of the guns up
      the clouds. It seemed to me a great battle, but the older hands here
      scarcely noticed it and sure enough this morning it was found that very
      little had been done.

    <p>
      SECRETARY STANTON:
    </p>
    <p>
      At 12.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphed me as follows: "There has
      been much hard fighting this morning. The enemy drove our left from near
      Dabney's house back well toward the Boydton plank road. We are now about
      to take the offensive at that point, and I hope will more than recover the
      lost ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later he telegraphed again as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our troops, after being driven back to the Boydton plank road, turned and
      drove the enemy in turn, and took the White Oak road, which we now have.
      This gives us the ground occupied by the enemy this morning. I will send
      you a rebel flag captured by our troops in driving the enemy back. There
      have been four flags captured to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Judging by the two points from which General Grant telegraphs, I infer
      that he moved his headquarters about one mile since he sent the first of
      the two despatches.

      they contain little additional, except that Sheridan also had pretty hot
      work yesterday, that infantry was sent to his support during the night,
      and that he (Grant) has not since heard from Sheridan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lincoln has started home, and I will thank you to see that our
      coachman is at the Arsenal wharf at eight o'clock to-morrow morning, there
      to wait until she arrives.

    <p>
      Despatch just received, showing that Sheridan, aided by Warren, had, at 2
      P.M., pushed the enemy back, so as to retake the Five Forks and bring his
      own headquarters up to J. Boisseau's. The Five Forks were barricaded by
      the enemy and carried by Devin's division of cavalry. This part of the
      enemy seem to now be trying to work along the White Oak road, to join the
      main force in front of Grant, while Sheridan and Warren are pressing them
      as closely as possible.

      Last night General Grant telegraphed that General Sheridan, with his

      train of wagons, and several batteries; the prisoners amounting to several
      thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning General Grant, having ordered an attack along the whole line,
      telegraphs as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both Wright and Parke got through the enemy's lines. The battle now rages
      furiously. General Sheridan, with his cavalry, the Fifth corps, and
      Miles's Division of the Second Corps, which was sent to him this morning,
      is now sweeping down from the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All now looks highly favorable. General Ord is engaged, but I have not
      yet heard the result in his front."

    <p>
      CITY POINT, April 1. 11.00 A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despatches are frequently coming in. All is going on finely. Generals
      Parke, Wright, and Ord's lines are extending from the Appomattox to
      Hatcher's Run. They have all broken through the enemy's intrenched lines,
      taking some forts, guns, and prisoners. Sheridan, with his own cavalry,
      the Fifth Corps, and part of the Second, is coming in from the west on the
      enemy's flank. Wright is already tearing up the Southside Railroad.

      CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, April 2. 2 P.M.

    <p>
      At 10.45 A.M. General Grant telegraphs as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything has been carried from the left of the Ninth Corps. The Sixth
      Corps alone captured more than three thousand prisoners. The Second and
      Twenty-fourth Corps captured forts, guns, and prisoners from the enemy,
      but I cannot tell the numbers. We are now closing around the works of the
      line immediately enveloping Petersburg. All looks remarkably well. I have
      not yet heard from Sheridan. His headquarters have been moved up to
      Banks's house, near the Boydton road, about three miles southwest of
      Petersburg."

      At 4.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphs as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are now up and have a continuous line of troops, and in a few hours
      will be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the river
      above. The whole captures since the army started out will not amount to
      less than twelve thousand men, and probably fifty pieces of artillery. I
      do not know the number of men and guns accurately, however. A portion of
      Foster's Division, Twenty Fourth Corps, made a most gallant charge this
      afternoon, and captured a very important fort from the enemy, with its
      entire garrison. All seems well with us, and everything is quiet just
      now."

    <p>
      LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT, in the Field:
    </p>
    <p>
      Secretary Seward was thrown from his carriage yesterday and seriously
      injured. This, with other matters, will take me to Washington soon. I was
      at Richmond yesterday and the day before, when and where Judge Campbell,
      who was with Messrs. Hunter and Stephens in February, called on me, and
      made such representations as induced me to put in his hands an informal
      paper, repeating the propositions in my letter of instructions to Mr.
      Seward, which you remember, and adding that if the war be now further
      persisted in by the rebels, confiscated property shall at the least bear
      the additional cost, and that confiscation shall be remitted to the people
      of any State which will now promptly and in good faith withdraw its troops
      and other support from resistance to the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Campbell thought it not impossible that the rebel legislature of
      Virginia would do the latter if permitted; and accordingly I addressed a
      private letter to General Weitzel, with permission to Judge Campbell to
      see it, telling him (General Weitzel) that if they attempt this, to permit
      and protect them, unless they attempt something hostile to the United
      States, in which case to give them notice and time to leave, and to arrest
      any remaining after such time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think it very probable that anything win come of this, but I have
      thought best to notify you so that if you should see signs you may
      understand them.
    </p>
    <p>
      From your recent despatches it seems that you are pretty effectually
      withdrawing the Virginia troops from opposition to the Government. Nothing
      that I have done, or probably shall do, is to delay, hinder, or interfere
      with your work.

      Whereas for some time past vessels of war of the United States have been
      refused in certain foreign ports, privileges and immunities to which they
      were entitled by treaty, public law, or the community of nations, at the
      same time that vessels of war of the country wherein the said privileges
      and immunities have been withheld have enjoyed them fully and
      uninterruptedly in ports of the United States, which condition of things
      has not always been forcibly resisted by the United States, although, on
      the other hand, they have not at any time failed to protest against and
      declare their dissatisfaction with the same. In the view of the United

      aforesaid, they shall continue to be so refused, then and thenceforth the
      same privileges and immunities shall be refused to the vessels of war of
      that country in the ports of the United States, and this refusal shall
      continue until war vessels of the United States shall have been placed
      upon an entire equality in the foreign ports aforesaid with similar
      vessels of other countries. The United States, whatever claim or pretense
      may have existed heretofore, are now, at least, entitled to claim and
      concede an entire and friendly equality of rights and hospitalities with

    <h2>
      LAST PUBLIC ADDRESS,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      APRIL 11, 1865
    </h3>
    <p>
      FELLOW-CITIZENS&mdash;We meet this evening not in sorrow, but in gladness
      of heart. The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of
      the principal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and speedy peace,
      whose joyous expression cannot be restrained. In the midst of this,
      however, He from whom blessings flow must not be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      A call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared, and will be duly
      promulgated. Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of
      rejoicing be overlooked. Their honors must not be parceled out with
      others. I myself was near the front, and had the pleasure of transmitting
      much of the good news to you. But no part of the honor for plan or
      execution is mine. To General Grant, his skillful officers, and brave men,
      all belongs. The gallant navy stood ready, but was not in reach to take
      active part. By these recent successes, the reinauguration of the national
      authority&mdash;reconstruction which has had a large share of thought from
      the first, is pressed much more closely upon our attention. It is fraught
      with great difficulty. Unlike a case of war between independent nations,
      there is no authorized organ for us to treat with&mdash;no one man has
      authority to give up the rebellion for any other man. We simply must begin
      with and mould from disorganized and discordant elements. Nor is it a
      small additional embarrassment that we, the loyal people, differ among
      ourselves as to the mode, manner, and measure of reconstruction. As a
      general rule, I abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself,
      Wishing not to be provoked by that to which I cannot properly offer an
      answer. In spite of this precaution, however, it comes to my knowledge
      that I am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking
      to sustain the new State government of Louisiana. In this I have done just
      so much and no more than the public knows. In the Annual Message of
      December, 1863, and the accompanying proclamation, I presented a plan of
      reconstruction, as the phrase goes, which I promised, if adopted by any
      State, would be acceptable to and sustained by the Executive Government of
      the nation. I distinctly stated that this was not the only plan that might
      possibly be acceptable, and I also distinctly protested that the Executive
      claimed no right to say when or whether members should be admitted to
      seats in Congress from such States. This plan was in advance submitted to
      the then Cabinet, and approved by every member of it. One of them
      suggested that I should then and in that connection apply the Emancipation
      Proclamation to the theretofore excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana;
      that I should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people,
      and that I should omit the protest against my own power in regard to the
      admission of members of Congress. But even he approved every part and
      parcel of the plan which has since been employed or touched by the action
      of Louisiana. The new constitution of Louisiana, declaring emancipation
      for the whole State, practically applies the proclamation to the part
      previously excepted. It does not adopt apprenticeship for freed people,
      and is silent, as it could not well be otherwise, about the admission of
      members to Congress. So that, as it applied to Louisiana, every member of
      the Cabinet fully approved the plan. The message went to Congress, and I
      received many commendations of the plan, written and verbal, and not a
      single objection to it from any professed emancipationist came to my
      knowledge until after the news reached Washington that the people of
      Louisiana had begun to move in accordance with it. From about July, 1862,
      I had corresponded with different persons supposed to be interested in
      seeking a reconstruction of a State government for Louisiana. When the
      message of 1863, with the plan before mentioned, reached New Orleans,
      General Banks wrote me that he was confident that the people, with his
      military co-operation, would reconstruct substantially on that plan. I
      wrote to him and some of them to try it. They tried it, and the result is
      known. Such has been my only agency in getting up the Louisiana
      government. As to sustaining it my promise is out, as before stated. But,
      as bad promises are better broken than kept, I shall treat this as a bad
      promise and break it, whenever I shall be convinced that keeping it is
      adverse to the public interest; but I have not yet been so convinced. I
      have been shown a letter on this subject, supposed to be an able one, in
      which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be
      definitely fixed upon the question whether the seceded States, so called,
      are in the Union or out of it. It would perhaps add astonishment to his
      regret were he to learn that since I have found professed Union men
      endeavoring to answer that question, I have purposely forborne any public
      expression upon it. As appears to me, that question has not been nor yet
      is a practically material one, and that any discussion of it, while it
      thus remains practically immaterial, could have no effect other than the
      mischievous one of dividing our friends. As yet, whatever it may become,
      that question is bad as the basis of a controversy, and good for nothing
      at all&mdash;a merely pernicious abstraction. We all agree that the
      seceded States, so called, are out of their proper practical relation with
      the Union, and that the sole object of the Government, civil and military,
      in regard to those States, is to again get them into their proper
      practical relation. I believe that it is not only possible, but in fact
      easier, to do this without deciding or even considering whether those
      States have ever been out of the Union, than with it. Finding themselves
      safely at home, it would be utterly immaterial whether they had been
      abroad. Let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restore the proper
      practical relations between these States and the Union, and each forever
      after innocently indulge his own opinion whether, in doing the acts he
      brought the States from without into the Union, or only gave them proper
      assistance, they never having been out of it. The amount of constituency,
      so to speak, on which the Louisiana government rests, would be more
      satisfactory to all if it contained fifty thousand, or thirty thousand, or
      even twenty thousand, instead of twelve thousand, as it does. It is also
      unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the
      colored man. I would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very
      intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers. Still, the
      question is not whether the Louisiana government, as it stands, is quite
      all that is desirable. The question is, Will it be wiser to take it as it
      is and help to improve it, or to reject and disperse? Can Louisiana be
      brought into proper practical relation with the Union sooner by sustaining
      or by discarding her new State government? Some twelve thousand voters in
      the heretofore Slave State of Louisiana have sworn allegiance to the
      Union, assumed to be the rightful political power of the State, held
      elections, organized a State government, adopted a Free State
      constitution, giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and
      white, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise
      upon the colored man. This Legislature has already voted to ratify the
      Constitutional Amendment recently passed by Congress, abolishing slavery
      throughout the nation. These twelve thousand persons are thus fully
      committed to the Union and to perpetuate freedom in the State&mdash;committed
      to the very things, and nearly all things, the nation wants&mdash;and they
      ask the nation's recognition and its assistance to make good this
      committal. Now, if we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to
      disorganize and disperse them. We, in fact, say to the white man: You are
      worthless or worse; we will neither help you nor be helped by you. To the
      blacks we say: This cup of liberty which these, your old masters, held to
      your lips, we will dash from you, and leave you to the chances of
      gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined
      when, where, and how. If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both
      white and black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper practical
      relations with the Union, I have so far been unable to perceive it. If, on
      the contrary, we recognize and sustain the new government of Louisiana,
      the converse of all this is made true. We encourage the hearts and nerve
      the arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work, and argue for it, and
      proselyte for it, and fight for it, and feed it, and grow it, and ripen it
      to a complete success. The colored man, too, in seeing all united for him,
      is inspired with vigilance, and energy, and daring to the same end. Grant
      that he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by
      saving the already advanced steps towards it, than by running backward
      over them? Concede that the new government of Louisiana is only to what it
      should be as the egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by
      hatching the egg than by smashing it. Again, if we reject Louisiana, we
      also reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the National
      Constitution. To meet this proposition, it has been argued that no more
      than three fourths of those States which have not attempted secession are
      necessary to validly ratify the amendment. I do not commit myself against
      this, further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable,
      and sure to be persistently questioned, while a ratification by three
      fourths of all the States would be unquestioned and unquestionable. I
      repeat the question, Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical
      relation with the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new
      State government? What has been said of Louisiana will apply to other
      States. And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each State, and such
      important and sudden changes occur in the same State, and withal so new
      and unprecedented is the whole case, that no exclusive and inflexible plan
      can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals. Such exclusive and
      inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement. Important
      principles may and must be inflexible. In the present situation as the
      phrase goes, it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people
      of the South. I am considering, and shall not fail to act, when satisfied
      that action will be proper.

      MAJOR-GENERAL WEITZEL, Richmond, Va.:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have just seen Judge Campbell's letter to you of the 7th. He assumes, as
      appears to me, that I have called the insurgent legislature of Virginia
      together, as the rightful legislature of the State, to settle all
      differences with the United States. I have done no such thing. I spoke of
      them, not as a legislature, but as "the gentlemen who have acted as the
      legislature of Virginia in support of the rebellion." I did this on
      purpose to exclude the assumption that I was recognizing them as a
      rightful body. I deal with them as men having power de facto to do a
      specific thing, to wit: "To withdraw the Virginia troops and other support
      from resistance to the General Government," for which, in the paper handed
      Judge Campbell, I promised a specific equivalent, to wit: a remission to
      the people of the State, except in certain cases, of the confiscation of
      their property. I meant this, and no more. Inasmuch, however, as Judge
      Campbell misconstrues this, and is still pressing for an armistice,
      contrary to the explicit statement of the paper I gave him, and
      particularly as General Grant has since captured the Virginia troops, so
      that giving a consideration for their withdrawal is no longer applicable,
      let my letter to you and the paper to Judge Campbell both be withdrawn, or
      countermanded, and he be notified of it. Do not now allow them to
      assemble, but if any have come, allow them safe return to their homes.

    <h2>
      INTERVIEW WITH SCHUYLER COLFAX ON THE MORNING OF APRIL 14, 1865.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Colfax, I want you to take a message from me to the miners whom you
      visit. I have very large ideas of the mineral wealth of our nation. I
      believe it practically inexhaustible. It abounds all over the Western
      country, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and its development has
      scarcely commenced. During the war, when we were adding a couple of
      millions of dollars every day to our national debt, I did not care about
      encouraging the increase in the volume of our precious metals. We had the
      country to save first. But now that the rebellion is overthrown, and we
      know pretty nearly the amount of our national debt, the more gold and
      silver we mine, we make the payment of that debt so much the easier.
      "Now," said he, speaking with more emphasis, "I am going to encourage that
      in every possible way. We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded
      soldiers, and many have feared that their return home in such great
      numbers might paralyze industry, by furnishing, suddenly, a greater supply
      of labor than there will be demand for. I am going to try to attract them
      to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges, where there is room enough
      for all. Immigration, which even the war has not stopped, will land upon
      our shores hundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded Europe. I
      intend to point them to the gold and silver that wait for them in the
      West. Tell the miners for me, that I shall promote their interests to the
      utmost of my ability; because their prosperity is the prosperity of the
      nation; and," said he, his eye kindling with enthusiasm, "we shall prove,
      in a very few years, that we are indeed the treasury of the world."

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
